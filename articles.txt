    "content": "\r\n\tIsrael launched a strike against Iran in retaliation for its weekend attack, said US officials, though media from both countries appeared to downplay the severity of the incident.\r\n\tIran activated its air defence system over several cities, state media reported, after the country's official broadcaster said explosions were heard near Isfahan, Iran's third-biggest city.\r\n\tSeveral Iranian nuclear sites are located in Isfahan province, including Natanz, centerpiece of Iran's uranium enrichment program. Nuclear facilities in Isfahan were reported to be \"completely secure\", Iran's Tasnim news agency said.\r\n\tThough some media reports said that missiles had been fired, Iran said that they have shot down several drones but there had been \"no missile attack for now\".\r\n\tSeveral drones \"have been successfully shot down by the country's air defence, there are no reports of a missile attack for now,\" Iran's space agency spokesman Hossein Dalirian said on X.\r\n\tIsrael government and military have not commented on the strike yet.

In addition, our warriors repelled another massive air attack and shot down 29 aerial targets: 2 Kh-101/Kh-555 cruise missiles; 14 Shahed UAVs; 11 Kh-59/Kh-69 guided air missiles; 2 Kh-22 cruise missiles.\"\r\n\r\nRussian officials said one member of the plane's crew died after it crashed over the southern Stavropol region while flying back to base.\r\n\r\n\"A Russian armed forces Tu-22M3 aircraft crashed in the Stavropol region while returning to the base aerodrome after performing a combat mission. The pilots ejected,\" the state-run TASS news agency quoted Russia's defence ministry as saying.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis morning, a Russian Tu-22M3 bomber crashed outside of Stavropol.\r\n\r\nFootage of the Russian bomber falling, burning and in a flatspin: pic.twitter.com/QJ5yg1vtSU\r\n— OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) April 19, 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a post on Telegram, Stavropol governor Vladimir Vladimirov also confirmed the death of the crew member and said two others were taken to a medical facility. &nbsp;\"The search for the fourth pilot is continuing,\" he added.\r\n\r\nStavropol is a region in Russia's north Caucasus, to the east of the annexed Crimean peninsula, which has seen multiple attacks throughout the war. Quoting the governor, the AFP report said the plane crashed in the region's Krasnogvardeysky district, about 400 km from the eastern edge of Crimea.\r\n\r\nThe main intelligence directorate of Ukraine's defence ministry said the plane \"was shot down at a distance of about 300 kilometres from Ukraine. As a result of the hit, the bomber was able to fly to the Stavropol area, where it crashed.\"&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Russian invasion began in February 2022.",

    "content": "Israel launched a retaliatory strike on Iran following last week's missile and drone barrage from Tehran, according to two US officials, though media from both countries appeared to downplay the severity of the incident.\r\n\r\nAn explosion was heard early Friday in Isfahan, Iran's third-biggest city, Fars news agency reported. Nuclear facilities located there are safe, state television and the United Nations' nuclear watchdog said.\r\n\r\nNeither the Iranian nor Israeli government has confirmed there was a strike by Israel. The Jewish state rarely comments on specific military actions linked to Iran.\r\n\r\nFlights were suspended in Isfahan and the Iranian cities of Tehran and Shiraz as well as airports across the country's western borders, but those restrictions were soon eased.\r\n\r\nThe incident follows days of frantic diplomacy from the US and European nations in which they tried to convince Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to respond too aggressively, if at all, to Saturday night's Iranian attack. Their main concern is to avoid a wider war in a region already roiled by the Israel-Hamas conflict and which could send oil prices above $100 a barrel.\r\n\r\nCrude and gold initially jumped in early trading on Friday, but later pared their gains as reports suggested the apparent attack was far from extensive. A senior Iranian military official also said Tehran had already responded to Israeli threats, and didn't blame the Jewish state for the latest incident.\r\n\r\nIsfahan is home to around 2 million people and several military bases and facilities. It's believed to have been one of several launch sites for Iran's attack on Israel on Saturday night.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times said two Israeli officials confirmed their nation was behind the strike. The newspaper also reported a military air base near Isfahan was struck.\r\n\r\nIsrael notified the US on Thursday it planned to retaliate in the next 24-48 hours, two American officials said to Bloomberg. They asked not to be identified discussing private conversations. Spokespeople for the National Security Council and the Pentagon declined to comment.\r\n\r\nBrent crude oil climbed above $90 a barrel before trading around $87.80 as of 9 a.m. in London, up less than 1% on the day.\r\n\r\nGold also quickly reversed its jump. Yields on 10-year US Treasuries — another haven for global investors in times of geopolitical stress — fell around four basis points to 4.59%.\r\n\r\nThe shekel weakened this week to its lowest level in 2024, though was steady on Friday at 3.78 per dollar. That was despite S&amp;P Global Ratings downgrading Israel by one level to A+ — still easily in investment-grade territory — hours before the reported attack.\r\n\r\nIsrael had vowed to retaliate against Iran for its barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles, the vast majority of which were destroyed before hitting their targets. While there was limited damage and no one was killed, Israel said it would send a message of weakness to Iran and its other enemies if it didn't respond.\r\n\r\nIran said it was a justified reaction to a strike on its embassy compound in Syria on April 1, which killed several Iranian officers and was blamed on Israel.\r\n\r\nThe US, Europe and Arab states urged Netanyahu to act with restraint. The foreign ministers of the UK and Germany both traveled to Israel on Wednesday to see him.\r\n\r\nNetanyahu faced a dilemma this week. While many of his far-right coalition members insisted on a firm response, the Israeli public was split on whether the country should react at all. Many, according to a poll, said it wasn't worth provoking Iran and straining Israel's ties with the US.\r\n\r\nIsrael is more than six months into the war in Gaza and still intent on attacking the city of Rafah, where it says several thousand Hamas fighters are lodged. Many in the country want the government to focus on finishing the conflict against the Iran-backed militant group that launched a deadly invasion on Oct. 7.\r\n\r\nBall in Iran's Court\r\n\r\nIf attributed to Israel, the nature and scope of the strike on Friday — including any casualties — could determine whether the tit-for-tat responses between the two sides escalate or start to get scaled back.\r\n\r\n\"The ball is in Iran's court now,\" said Ziad Daoud, chief emerging-market economist for Bloomberg Economics. \"The most likely scenario is avoiding escalation through another direct attack on Israel.\"\r\n\r\nMany analysts had said targeting Iran's nuclear facilities would be the riskiest and most aggressive option open to Israel, with strikes on non-nuclear military facilities and cyberattacks among the less escalatory choices.\r\n\r\nEarly indications are that this was a \"symbolic attack\" that won't force Iran to respond aggressively, retired Israeli General Israel Ziv told the nation's Channel 12.\r\n\r\nIsrael's hawkish national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, suggested he wasn't happy with his country's apparent response.\r\n\r\n\"Weak,\" he said in a one-word post on X in Hebrew.\r\n\r\nBen Gvir isn't part of Netanyahu's Likud party and doesn't sit in the five-man war cabinet that takes final decisions on military actions. But he's key to the survival of Netanyahu's coalition and said after Iran's attack that Israel had to hit back hard.\r\n\r\nIranian media portrayed a sense of calm in Isfahan and asserted that everything was proceeding as normal. The country's Supreme National Security Council decided against convening for an emergency meeting, according to state TV.\r\n\r\nIran was bracing for a reprisal by Israel all week.\r\n\r\nTehran has routinely accused Israel of attacks and sabotage activities targeting its nuclear and military sites in the past, including in Isfahan, home to some key nuclear enrichment and missile facilities. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes but the West accuses it of seeking to develop atomic weapons.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, Iran said it may reconsider its nuclear policies if Israel attacked its atomic sites.\r\n\r\nIranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian also warned Israel against lashing out after the weekend assault.\r\n\r\n\"In case the Israeli regime embarks on adventurism again and takes action against the interests of Iran, the next response from us will be immediate and at a maximum level,\" he said to CNN.",

    "content": "Canada on Thursday cracked one of the most audacious heists in its history, unravelling a web of criminal activity that intertwined gold, cash, and firearms. The plot, reminiscent of a script straight out of a crime thriller, unfolded at Toronto's Pearson International Airport, leaving investigators grappling with a multimillion-dollar puzzle.\r\n\r\nThe heist, which took place on April 17 in 2023, saw an unexplained disappearance of a staggering cache of riches: over 22 million Canadian dollars' worth of gold bars and foreign currency stolen away from a secure storage facility within the airport's premises. The modus operandi to carry out the heist involved forged paperwork to gain access to the precious cargo.\r\n\r\nThe Heist&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn April 17 last year, cargo container arrived at Pearson International Airport from Zurich, Switzerland, aboard an Air Canada flight. Inside were 6,600 bars of .9999% pure gold, weighing 400 kilograms, along with 2.5 million Canadian dollars' worth in foreign currency. The precious cargo was destined for secure storage within the airport premises before reaching its final destinations. However, they never did.\r\n\r\nSurveillance footage captured the moment when the truck, driven by one of the accused, pulled up to the warehouse and loaded the container filled with gold bars and banknotes. Within hours of its arrival, the valuable cargo vanished into the night, setting off a chain of events that would reverberate across borders.\r\n\r\nCentral to the heist plan were individuals employed by Air Canada, the country's flag carrier, who allegedly played key roles in facilitating the theft. Among those arrested were former and current employees, including Parmpal Sidhu and Simran Preet Panesar, whose positions within the airline provided them with insider knowledge crucial to executing the heist.\r\n\r\nThe Hunt\r\n\r\nThe police were alerted to the disappearance of the cargo the following morning, setting off an investigation that spanned international jurisdictions. After months of relentless investigation, law enforcement agencies made significant breakthroughs. Arrests were made, warrants were issued, and a web of connections began to unravel.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe investigation uncovered a labyrinthine network of individuals, including those of Indian origin, involved in the crime.\r\n\r\nThe saga did not end with the heist itself. In a dramatic turn of events, police on both sides of the US-Canada border joined forces, unravelling a nexus between the stolen gold and an illegal firearms trafficking operation. The arrest of Durante King-Mclean, a 25-year-old man from Brampton, in the US exposed a parallel criminal network, revealing ties between the gold thieves and a scheme to smuggle firearms into Canada.\r\n\r\nPolice seized evidence suggesting that the stolen gold had been melted down and transformed into other forms, such as jewellery, in an attempt to conceal its origins.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn total, seven were arrested after a year-long investigation.",

    "content": "A Telangana BJP Lok Sabha candidate's gesture at an election rally - pretending to draw and fire an arrow while near a mosque - has been heavily criticised, with AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi slamming the \"vulgar, obscene, and provocative\" action during a Ram Navami rally on Wednesday\r\n\r\nThe BJP leader in question - Madhavai Latha is the party's candidate for the Hyderabad seat, which has been held by Mr Owaisi since 2004 and his father, Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi, since 1989. Ms Latha posted a statement on X Thursday evening, after the row erupted, professing to apologise \"if anyone's feelings are hurt\". However, she also claimed the video circulated is \"incomplete\".\r\n\r\nIn a 10-second clip that has been widely shared, Ms Latha, dressed in saffron and with a garland of yellow flowers around her neck, makes a dramatic flourish. She pretends to draw an arrow from a quiver on her back, notches the pretend arrow, and then fires the imaginary weapon, at which point loud music is played. The clip online pans to show the mosque at the point she fires the 'arrow'.\r\n\r\nAfter criticism of the video, the BJP leader posed on X, \"It has come to my notice that a video of mine is being circulated in the media to create negativity. I would like to clarify that this is an incomplete video and if anyone's feelings are hurt due to such a video, I would like to apologise...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nमेरे संज्ञान में आया है कि मेरा एक वीडियो मीडिया में नकारात्मकता पैदा करने के लिए प्रसारित किया जा रहा है।\r\nमैं स्पष्ट करना चाहती हूँ कि यह एक अधूरा वीडियो है और ऐसे वीडियो के कारण भी अगर किसी की भावनाएं आहत होती हैं तो मैं माफी मांगना चाहूंगी क्योंकि मैं सभी का सम्मान करती हूँ।\r\n— Kompella Madhavi Latha (Modi Ka Parivar) (@Kompella_MLatha) April 18, 2024\r\n\r\n\r\nShe also spoke to news agency PTI, claiming a \"conspiracy against us (the BJP)... because we work well with both Hindu and Muslim brothers\" and demanded \"where did the mosque come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday, on the occasion of Ram Navami, I was gesturing shooting an (imaginary) arrow towards the sky.

    "content": "Arvind Kejriwal has petitioned Delhi's Rouse Avenue Court seeking directions to Tihar Jail officials to provide him with insulin. The plea will be heard at 2 PM, news agency ANI said.\r\n\r\nThe Delhi Chief Minister - arrested last month in the alleged liquor policy scam case - is a Type 2 diabetes patient who, his Aam Aadmi Party alleged last night, \"is not being given insulin despite repeated requests\". AAP leader Atishi claimed a \"conspiracy to kill\" Mr Kejriwal.\r\n\r\nAtishi's charge came hours after the Enforcement Directorate - which arrested Mr Kejriwal on March 21 - opposed a request for a video consult with his regular doctor. The probe agency's lawyer told the Rouse Avenue Court that the AAP leader's condition, if serious, had been triggered by regularly eating mangoes and sweets, and drinking tea with sugar, none of which is advised for diabetics.\r\n\r\n\"(Mr Kejriwal's) diet chart has mangoes and sweets on it... it has been placed before the court. (Mr Kejriwal) is regularly consuming foods not permitted for any diabetic patient,\" the agency's lawyer said.\r\n\r\nThe ED, therefore, opposed Mr Kejriwal's request for a video consult with his regular doctor.\r\n\r\nREAD |&nbsp;AAP Claims \"Plan To Kill Kejriwal In Jail\" Amid \"Eating Mangoes\" Row\r\n\r\nA furious Atishi hit back hours later, accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party of \"not (being) able to defeat Arvind Kejriwal in three elections (referring to the Delhi Assembly polls)\".\r\n\r\n\"... (so) a plan is being hatched to kill him by keeping him in jail,\" Atishi declared.\r\n\r\n\"Everyone knows Arvind Kejriwal is a patient of severe diabetes... he has been suffering for the past 30 years. To keep his sugar level under control he takes 54 units of insulin daily,\" she continued.\r\n\r\n\"Ask any doctor... only someone who has severe diabetes takes this much insulin. That is why the court allowed Arvind Kejriwal to eat home-cooked food... prescribed by the doctor.\"\r\n\r\nREAD |&nbsp;AAP Says Kejriwal Unwell, Lost 4.5 Kg In Jail, Officials Disagree\r\n\r\nAtishi also countered the ED's claim Mr Kejriwal has been eating sweets inside the jail, saying, \"This is a complete lie... Kejriwalji is allowed to tea and sweets with a sweetener (as) prescribed by the doctor. This is a low-calorie sweetener given to diabetics.\"\r\n\r\nShe also slammed the ED over claims Mr Kejriwal is eating bananas to increase his blood sugar level, which reportedly fell to a dangerously low 46 Mg when he was first incarcerated. \"I would like to say to the ED... talk to any diabetes doctor. Patients are told to keep banana and some kind of toffee...\"\r\n\r\n\"If the ED read the court order, it is clearly written that when Kejriwalji is in ED custody, or jail, he must always have some kind of toffee and banana (with him),\" she said, referring to a direction that the AAP leader be allowed home-cooked food, bottled drinking water, and a supply of toffees.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena has asked the the city's top prison official to submit a report into allegations Mr Kejriwal was not being provided insulin in Tihar jail.\r\n\r\nWhy Was Arvind Kejriwal Arrested?\r\n\r\nArvind Kejriwal was arrested by the ED on March 21 in connection with the alleged liquor policy scam in the national capital. The probe agency believes the Chief Minister played a key role in drafting the now-scrapped policy and seeking bribes, or kickbacks, in return for liquor licences.\r\n\r\nREAD |&nbsp;Kejriwal To Stay In Jail For Now, Top Court Refuses Early Hearing\r\n\r\nThe AAP and Mr Kejriwal have refused all charges and called the arrest and case \"political vendetta\", coming as it did, weeks before the Lok Sabha election.\r\n\r\nMr Kejriwal has challenged his arrest in the Supreme Court. However, the top court has refused an early hearing. He must now wait till April 29, when the court reconvenes to hear the ED's reply.\r\n\r\nNDTV is now available on WhatsApp channels.

    "content": "Businessman Raj Kundra shared a cryptic post about staying calm late last night after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) seized his assets worth Rs 97.79 crore in a probe linked to a Bitcoin ponzi scam.\r\n\r\nMr Kundra, the husband of Bollywood actor Shilpa Shetty, shared the photo of a roaring lion on Instagram Stories with a text on it reading: \"Learning to stay calm when you feel disrespected is a different type of growth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe assets seized from them include a residential flat in Juhu, which is registered in Shilpa Shetty's name, a residential bungalow in Pune, and equity shares of Mr Kundra.\r\n\r\nThe couple have denied any involvement in the case. In a statement yesterday, their lawyer said no case is made out against them and they have faith in a fair investigation.\r\n\r\n\"There is no prima facie case made out against my clients Mr Raj Kundra and Mrs Shilpa Shetty Kundra. I believe when we make our fair representation before the Honourable Enforcement Directorate, even the investigation agencies may grant justice to us. We have faith in the fair investigation,\" said their lawyer Prashant Patil.\r\n\r\nA Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud where investors are lured with promises of huge profits at little or no risk. But instead of investing the money, the conmen try to lure more investors and pay initial investors with funds from the recent ones.\r\n\r\nThe latest probe pertains to allegations that Mr Kundra had received 285 bitcoins from the mastermind behind the Ponzi scheme, which he intended to use to establish a Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. However, the deal did not materialize and left Mr Kundra with Bitcoins worth over Rs 150 crore.\r\n\r\nThis is not the first time Mr Kundra is facing a police probe. In 2021, he was arrested in a case involving the production and distribution of pornographic films. The Supreme Court later granted him bail.",

In a statement, the top poll official said the group had attempted \"to use undue influence... by interfering with the free exercise of those residing in Eastern Nagaland areas to vote in the general election\". The ENPO, the officer said, is therefore \"directed to show cause... as to why action under subsection of Section 171C of the Indian Penal Code should not be initiated\".\r\n\r\nThe relevant subsection says \"whoever voluntarily interferes, or attempts to interfere, with the free exercise of any electoral right commits the offence of undue influence at the election\".\r\n\r\nREAD |&nbsp;Nagaland Group Decides To Boycott Lok Sabha Polls\r\n\r\nThe ENPO has responded saying the \"main goal\" of the public notification was to \"reduce the possibility of disturbances in the Eastern Nagaland region, which is under our jurisdiction, and the risk linked with gatherings of anti-social elements\". The organisation underlined the fact \"the Eastern Nagaland region is presently under Public Emergency\", and that this was declared after consultations with stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis was a \"voluntary initiative\" by the people, the ENPO said, arguing that action under Section 171C \"is not applicable... as no offence related to undue influence at any election is committed...\"\r\n\r\n\"Given that the shutdown was a voluntary initiative by the people, there was no question of coercion or enforcement by the ENPO or any other authority,\" the statement said, also adding that it is willing to cooperate with the Election Commission \"if there has been any misunderstanding or misinterpretation\".\r\n\r\nOn March 30 the ENPO held a lengthy closed-door meeting with 20 MLAs and other organisations, at which they reiterated the decision to totally abstain from the Lok Sabha election. The Eastern Nagaland Legislators' Union - consisting of the 20 MLAs - had asked the ENPO to reconsider its decision.\r\n\r\nNDTV Live Coverage |&nbsp;Lok Sabha Elections Phase 1 2024 Live Updates:\r\n\r\nThe following day the ENPO told the Election Commission of India about their move to not cast votes in the election. It said the decision was not taken lightly and \"reflects the sentiments and aspirations of the people of Eastern Nagaland, who have tirelessly advocated for our rights and aspirations within the framework of democratic governance\". The decision is not, it said, an act of defiance versus democracy.\r\n\r\nREAD |&nbsp;Won't Participate In Polls, Promise Unfulfilled: Eastern Nagaland Group\r\n\r\nhe 'public emergency' was declared on March 8. During this time the ENPO - the apex body of seven Naga tribes of the region - and its frontal organisations did not permit poll campaigns.\r\n\r\nThe ENPO also gave an abstention call before last year's Assembly election, but this was withdrawn after an assurance from Union Home Minister Amit Shah.\r\n\r\nNagaland has one Lok Sabha seat, which has been held by the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party's Tokheho Yepthomi since a 2018 bypoll.

Mr Shah's declaration comes on the heels of a confrontation between Chhattisgarh security forces and Maoists, resulting in the deaths of 29 left-wing extremists, including a high-ranking rebel leader, Shankar Rao, who carried a bounty of Rs 25 lakh on his head.\r\n\r\n\"There has been no change to the BJP's commitment against Naxalism. It is not democratic and should be eradicated. I, PM Modi and everyone have appealed to welcome those who lay down their weapons. But if you pick up arms, you will get an answer from security forces,\" Mr Shah told NDTV\r\n\r\nTuesday's clash took place in the Hapatola forest near Binagunda village within Chhattisgarh's Kanker district. A joint operation conducted by the Border Security Force (BSF) and the state police's District Reserve Guard (DRG) led to a fierce gun battle. Three security personnel sustained injuries - two from the BSF and one from the DRG, underlining the intensity of the encounter.\r\n\r\n\"Congress has called this encounter fake. When Congress was in power in Chhattisgarh, there were no operations against Naxals. In 90 days, our government launched an operation, 87 Naxals have been killed, 123 Naxals have been arrested and 253 have surrendered,\" Mr added.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSince Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai's government came to power in December 2023, Chhattisgarh has witnessed a surge in proactive counterinsurgency operations.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\"The pace with which things are being done, Naxalism will be completely eradicated from India in one or two years,\" the home minister said.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTuesday's operation in Kanker adds to the tally of 79 Maoists felled in separate engagements with security forces this year in Chhattisgarh's Bastar region, which encompasses seven districts, including Kanker.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "Already a match-winner for Mumbai Indians, Jasprit Bumrah isn't entirely a happy man when it comes to his role in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 season. The seasoned seamer has emerged as the wrecker-in-chief for his franchise, picking up wickets at regular intervals, but he wants more responsibilities on his shoulders. After emerging as the player of the match for his franchise in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 match against Punjab Kings on Thursday, Bumrah made it clear to the skipper Hardik Pandya the role he wants to play.\r\n\r\nBurmah's figures of 3 for 21 in 4 overs proved to be the difference as Mumbai Indians beat Punjab Kings by 9 runs. After the game, however, Bumrah said that he wants to be bowling in the powerplay early on when the ball is offering some swing. This season, his role, however, has been quite different.\r\n\r\n\"Much closer game than what we thought. Want to make an impact early on. In this format, the ball swings for two overs, and you want to make use of that. This format is a little difficult for the bowlers because the batsmanship is going over, plus the time restrictions and the Impact Player rule. What you can do is prepare your best and back yourself. Go out there and give your best. I try to relay messages from wherever I am on the field. You don't want to give too many messages,\" Bumrah said in the post-match presentation.\r\n\r\nFor Mumbai Indians, the likes of Haridk Pandya, Gerald Coetzee and Akash Madhwal have been used more in the powerplays, in comparison to Bumrah. Against Punjab, Bumrah bowled the 2nd and the 4th over, and ended up claiming 2 wickets. The pacer wants more such roles to be given to him by captain Hardik.\r\n\r\nRecapping the match, Punjab Kings sent Mumbai Indians to bat first. Following that a fiery knock from Suryakumar (78) propeled MI to 192/7. Apart rom SKY, Rohit Sharma (36) and Tilak Varma (34) played a pivotal role in the inning and helped MI to add valuable runs on the scoreboard.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Harshal Patel led the Punjab Kings bowling attack after he bagged three wickets. Skipper Sam Curran took two wickets on the other hand.\r\n\r\nDuring the run chase, Ashutosh (61) and Shashank Singh (41) were the standout batters for the hosts and tried to take Punjab closer to the target. However, Gerald Coetzee and Jasprit Bumrah's three wicket haul helped MI to successfuly defend their target.\r\n\r\nBumrah was named the 'Player of the Match' after he picked up three wickets and gave 21 runs in his four-over spell.\r\n\r\nWith ANI inputs",

    "content": "The world has its fingers crossed as Iran's state media has reported explosions in the Isfahan province, days after Iran's drone attack on Israel sparked fears of a major escalation in West Asia.\r\n\r\nWhile Israel authorities have not confirmed a strike and Iran state-media, too, has downplayed claims of an attack on a military site, US media has quoted officials saying that Israel had carried out retaliatory strikes.\r\n\r\nWhat Happened In Isfahan\r\n\r\nIran's Fars news agency reported early on Friday that \"three explosions\" were heard near Shekari army airbase in the northwest of Isfahan province, news agency AFP reported. Hossein Dalirian, spokesperson for the Iran's space agency, said several drones had been shot down and there had been \"no missile attack for now\". An unnamed US official has told CNN that the target was not nuclear. Iran's Tasnim news agency, which has links with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, reported that nuclear facilities in Isfahan are \"completely secure\". Tasnim also denied that Iran had been attacked from abroad.\r\n\r\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed there is \"no damage\" to Iran's nuclear sites. \"DG @rafaelmgrossi continues to call for extreme restraint from everybody and reiterates that nuclear facilities should never be a target in military conflicts. IAEA is monitoring the situation very closely,\" a statement said.\r\n\r\nA New York Times report quoted Iranian officials as saying that the strike had hit a military air base near Isfahan.\r\n\r\nThe attack also coincided with the 85th birthday of Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHow Iran Responded\r\n\r\nIran's state media reported that air defence systems over several cities in the country were activated early on Friday. Flights to Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz were suspended and UAE-based flydubai airline cancelled flights to the country. Two Tehran airports, however, resumed service later.\r\n\r\nAccording to news agency AFP, flight tracking software showed commercial flights avoiding western Iran, including Isfahan. Iranian television carried a live feed of normal traffic conditions at a roundabout in Isfahan.\r\n\r\nTasnim news agency reported that Iranian TV reported complete security and peace at the Isfahan nuclear site. It also said a senior army official in Isfahan had confirmed that the explosion heard in the province was due to the firing of anti-aircraft weapons targeting \"suspicious objects\". Dalirian said three drones were shot down.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhy Isfahan Is Important\r\n\r\nIsfahan houses nuclear experimental reactors and uranium conversion facilities. It is also home to Iran's underground Natanz enrichment site, which has been repeatedly targeted by suspected Israeli sabotage attacks, Associated Press reported. Isfahan also houses Iran's fleet of US-made F-14 Tomcats that were bought before the Iranian Revolution in 1979.\r\n\r\nGhahjaworstan, where an explosion was heard, is located near Isfahan airport and is \"the eighth hunting base of the Army Air Force\", news agency FARS reported.\r\n\r\nThe strike in Isfahan is particularly significant against the backdrop of Iran's warning to Israel.\r\n\r\nDays after the missile strike on Israel, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps warned that it would attack Israel's nuclear sites and may pursue a nuclear weapon if the country strikes at Iran's nuclear facilities. \"The nuclear facilities of the Zionist enemy have been identified and all the necessary information from all targets is at our disposal,\" Brigadier General Ahmad Haghtalab was quoted as saying by Tasnim.\r\n\r\n\"Our fingers are on the trigger of firing strong missiles to destroy the designated targets in response to a potential attack by them,\" said the commander of the IRGC division that is tasked with protecting Iranian nuclear facilities.\r\n\r\n\"If the fake Zionist regime wants to use the threat of attacking the nuclear centres of our country as a tool, reconsidering the doctrine and policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and deviating from previously stated considerations would be likely and imaginable,\" he had said, in what was Iran's most direct warning yet.\r\n\r\nWhat Now?\r\n\r\nIsrael has not commented officially on the attack yet. Israeli military told news agency AFP: \"We don't have a comment at this time.\" Israel's national security minister Itamar Ben-Givir's one-word post on X read, \"weak\".\r\n\r\nThe White House and Pentagon, too, are yet to make a statement. US media reports quoting officials have said Washington did receive an advance notice of the reported strike, but did not endorse it or play any part in its execution.\r\n\r\nAccording to The Times of Israel, no official remark from Israel and the limited nature of the strike may provide Iran a position of strategic deniability - much needed for a de-escalation in the region. But if Israel comes on record to own up its role in the strike, all eyes will be on how Iran responds.\r\n\r\nThe world is watching with bated breath how the situation is unfolding in the sensitive region, where Israel is already waging a war in Gaza in retaliation to the October 7 attack by Hamas.\r\n\r\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that spiralling tensions over the war in Gaza and Iran's attack on Israel could devolve into a \"full-scale regional conflict.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Middle East is on a precipice. Recent days have seen a perilous escalation -- in words and deeds,\" he has told the UN Security Council. \"One miscalculation, one miscommunication, one mistake, could lead to the unthinkable --- a full-scale regional conflict that would be devastating for all involved,\" he has said, calling for restraint.",

    "content": "Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya has been handed a fine for Code of Conduct breach in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 match against Punjab Kings on Thursday. Hardik, captaining the Mumbai franchise, failed to complete the 20 overs of bowling in the stipulated time, and hence, has been handed a fine of INR 12 lakh. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), in a statement, confirmed the same. With this being only the first instance where Hardik failed to match the over-rate criteria, only Rs. 12 lakh fine was imposed.\r\n\r\n\"Hardik Pandya, the Mumbai Indians captain, has been fined after his team maintained a slow over rate during their Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 match against Punjab Kings at the PCA New International Cricket Stadium, Mullanpur on April 18,\" BCCI statement said after the match.\r\n\r\nA repeat of the offence could find Hardik and other Mumbai Indians players in a bigger trouble.\r\n\r\nAs for the match, MI held onto their nerves to secure their third win of the IPL 2024 campaign.\r\n\r\nChasing a mammoth total of 193 runs, PBKS didn't have the start they wanted as they lost the wicket of opener Prabhsimran Singh, who was sent back to the dressing room without opening his account in the first over of the second innings when the team score was 10.\r\n\r\nThe Kings lost their second wicket at the score of 13 when Rossouw was dismissed after scoring just 1 run, and the third wicket fell at 14 when Curran was sent back to the pavilion after scoring six runs.\r\n\r\nAt the score of 14, the Punjab side lost the fourth wicket as Liam Livingstone was dismissed after scoring just 1 run, courtesy of Gerald Coetzee's bowling.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of four wickets, the impact player Harpreet Singh Bhatia came out to the crease. Bhatia, along with Shashank Singh, built a small partnership of 35 runs as the hosts lost half of their side at the score of 49, with Bhatia being dismissed after scoring 13 runs.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of the fifth wicket, PBKS wicketkeeper-batter Jitesh Sharma came out to bat along with Shashank. Both batters were able to put on 28 runs before Jitesh was dismissed after scoring just nine runs.\r\n\r\nAfter Jitesh's wicket, Ashutosh Sharma came out to bat. He, along with Shashank, put on a partnership of 34 runs before the latter was dismissed after playing a brilliant knock of 41 runs from just 25 balls, laced with three maximums and two boundaries.\r\n\r\nAshutosh slammed 61 runs in just 28 balls with the help of seven sixes and two fours, and Harpreet Brar (21 from 20) played crucial knocks for the side, but that was not enough to cross the line for the Punjab side as they were bowled out for 183 runs in the last over.\r\n\r\nWith ANI Inputs",

    "content": "Scientists have said that a fossil vertebrae unearthed in Gujarat are the remains of the largest snake that ever lived, which was longer than the T-rex. The discovery of 'Vasuki Indicus' was made in 2005 by scientists from IIT-Roorkee and recently confirmed as a giant snake. It establishes India's crucial link in the origin and evolutionary process of various species, especially reptiles. The researchers have discovered 27 vertebrae from the snake, and some of them looks like a large python and would not have been venomous. They estimate the length of the snake to be in the range of 11-15 metres (about 50 feet) and it must have weighed 1 tonne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIIT Roorkee's Prof. Sunil Bajpai &amp; Debajit Datta discovered Vasuki Indicus, a 47-million-year-old snake species in Kutch, Gujarat. Estimated at 11-15 meters, this extinct snake sheds light on India's prehistoric biodiversity. Published in Scientific Reports. #SnakeDiscovery pic.twitter.com/ruLsfgPQCc\r\n— IIT Roorkee (@iitroorkee) April 18, 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research was published in 'Scientific Reports' on 'Springer Nature' on Thursday.\r\n\r\n\"Considering its large size, Vasuki was a slow-moving ambush predator that would subdue its prey through constriction like anacondas and pythons. This snake lived in a marshy swamp near the coast at a time when global temperatures were higher than today,\" Debajit Datta, a postdoctoral researcher in palaeontology at IIT-Roorkee and the lead author of the study, told The Guardian.\r\n\r\nThe fossil has been named after Vasuki, the snake king associated with Lord Shiva.\r\n\r\nIts size rivals Titanoboa, which once lived in Colombia around 60 million years ago. It measured about 43 feet in length and weighed more than one tonne.\r\n\r\n\"The estimated body length of Vasuki is comparable to that of Titanoboa, although the vertebrae of Titanoboa are slightly larger than those of Vasuki. However, at this point, we cannot say if Vasuki was more massive or slender compared to Titanoboa,\" Sunil Bajpai, a palaeontologist, professor at Roorkee and the study's co-author, told the outlet.\r\n\r\nThe largest living snake today is Asia's reticulated python at 10 metres (33 feet).\r\n\r\nThough the fossil was found in an area that is dry and dusty today, it was swampy when Vasuki roamed the Earth, said Mr Bajpai.\r\n\r\nThe discovery gives scientists not only a closer look into the evolution of snakes but also a deeper understanding of how continents physically shifted over time and species dispersed across the globe, a per Scientific American.",

    "content": "\r\n\r\n\r\n(The following is an excerpt from 'Crypto Crimes: Inside India's Best-Kept Secret' by&nbsp;Mitali Mukherjee. Published with the permission of HarperCollins. Subheadings added by NDTV for ease of reading)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dark web has gone from strength to strength, and India is high on the list of users. According to a Statista survey in 2019, India accounts for 26 per cent of the global population using the dark web, the highest usage worldwide.\r\n\r\nEase of Doing Business\r\n\r\nThis is what we know of the highly opaque dark web, and how the drug market survives and thrives in India. There's no clarity on the number of people on the dark web in India because of its very nature, which provides complete concealment. As one crypto expert, who wishes to remain anonymous, explains with a laugh: 'Even college students are now using it to get their assignments ghostwritten for a fee. What is clear is that the number has been increasing every year. In the early years, people did not know how to use or access it, but now the browser is publicly available, making downloading easier. And it's free. There's no clarity on the age group that is the most active on these dark websites either. What is clear and apparent is the stuff that's up for sale. Betting, drugs, child pornography and data leakage. The dark web is flooded with Aadhaar details and passwords of unsuspecting Indian citizens. People in India are very lax about their passwords. While the largest bucket of money in India currently is in the betting market, scamsters abound with private and leaked details of many ordinary Indians.'\r\n\r\nMore and more people are buying their drugs on the dark web than at any other time in recorded history. In the 2021 Global Drug Survey,26 researchers found that in 2020, 15% of survey participants who reported using drugs in the previous twelve months had obtained them from dark web marketplaces-either by purchasing them first-hand or via someone else. There was a three-fold jump in the percentage of such people since 2014, which is when the survey first started measuring the trend.\r\n\r\nHow does the now flourishing drug market work for a buyer and seller on the dark web?\r\n\r\n\r\n\tStep one: Select a website. Buyers usually pick one with a high reputation for delivering on time.\r\n\tStep two: Create an account and username on that website.\r\n\tStep three: A wallet address will be given for the purchase plus a time limit. The buyer needs to pay within that time and share a screenshot confirming the payment is done. The moment the payment is okayed, the order will be processed.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nTwo features are key in this process - that there is a middleman, the handler of the website, and that the payment will only be made in crypto. Bitcoin remains the most popular coin for these sales and the drugs available range from purple hash to various types of cocaine, the highest quality of weed, LSD, and MDMA, more commonly known as Ecstasy.\r\n\r\nThe players in India are among the smartest, frequently changing the names of their sites, ensuring that the actual coordinates of where these lethal substances are is never ever revealed. While very little is known about them, veterans in the field allude to a type. 'Techies', as they are often called - young people with brilliant minds for all things technology, and perhaps a taste for crime.\r\n\r\nThe Arrest of Dipu Singh\r\n\r\nA twenty-one-year-old bachelor in hotel management from Amity University in Lucknow, Dipu Singh's social media pictures show a sharply dressed young man in a suit, with a well-groomed beard and a big smile. The son of a retired Army officer, Dipu looked like he had a bright and exciting future waiting for him. Until he was arrested by the NCB on 31 January 2020.\r\n\r\nThe NCB describes Dipu Singh as India's first narcotics vendor on the dark web to be caught. He is allegedly the mastermind behind hundreds of drug parcels clandestinely couriered to countries like the US, the UK, and many in Europe, using the dark web and crypto.\r\n\r\nIt started off under the commonest of garbs-sex pills. Dipu started with shipping medicines related to erectile dysfunction and fitness supplements to overseas locations using the dark web. When he saw the profit margins in psychotropic drugs, his game plan changed. He soon became a major player on the dark web; his listings were found in some of the biggest and reliable dark web markets like Empire Market and Majestic Garden. Orders were procured from the dark web and routed through secure messaging platforms like Wickr and WhatsApp. As his fame grew, so did his markets.\r\n\r\n'Operation Trance'\r\n\r\nUnbeknownst to him, the International Narcotics Control Board had started an investigation in December 2019 to gather information from officers in different countries about these shipments. The NCB was now part of a global 'Operation Trance' that saw joint intelligence gathering action on international postal, express mail, and courier shipments containing psychotropic drugs that are abused as sedatives and painkillers.\r\n\r\nIn December 2019 alone, NCB officials from Delhi and Mumbai seized over 55,000 psychotropic tablets worth Rs 45 lakh, from Delhi, Mumbai, and the UK. In early January 2020, customs officials in Delhi seized a package. Its source was traced to Lucknow, and all trails led to Dipu Singh.\r\n\r\nHis name was listed as an active vendor on Empire Market. He was working under the username 'Mr Robo' and had created fake IDs and tried to purchase a few drugs. Investigations showed payment gateways of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins and Litecoin were used by the operators to conceal the transactions from regulatory agencies.\r\n\r\nSmall Fish In A Giant Ocean\r\n\r\nSingh's interrogation - as pieced together from news reports and the Narcotics Bureau's own tweets - revealed that he was brought into the drug syndicate in 2018 by a man who operates an online pharmacy, which had offered him a job to deliver medicines online. By early 2019, Singh associated with dark web markets and began supplying psychotropic tablets illegally to clients abroad. At last count, he had sent over 600 consignments of drugs using the dark web and used crypto as his channel for payments.\r\n\r\nWhile investigating authorities assert this is a big win, critics are quick to point out these arrests are small fish in a giant ocean. As Macksofy founder Yasir Shaikh explains, drug cartels and the associated gang warfare that comes with the turf have now moved online. That means attacks are frequently launched against the websites of competitors to take them offline. By selling directly to users, dealers are slashing risk, cutting middlemen, and boosting profit margins. But players like Dipu Singh represent extremely small proportions of a market that is booming globally. So, while small vendors sometimes get caught, the big players keep changing their names, and their cat-and-mouse game with enforcement authorities continues.\r\n\r\n(Disclaimer: The author and publisher of the book are solely responsible for the contents of the book or any excerpt derived therefrom.

    "content": "There is a dichotomy in Love Sex Aur Dhokha 2 that makes itself instantly apparent. The film probes the not-so-secret virtual lives of a generation of youngsters with severely limited attention spans even as it demands complete focus on its bewilderingly whimsical flow of images and sounds. You take your eyes off the screen or let your mind wander for a split second and you are at risk of missing a crucial piece of information or a prickly flash of an image that is meant to speaks volumes. With its constant zaniness and unpredictability, the film's rhythm reflects the untamable impatience of technology-obsessed, instant fame-seeking influencers and YouTubers who inhabit a world of their own for better or for worse.\r\n\r\nLSD 2 reveals the many ways in which violence, physical and psychological, is perpetrated on those who exist within the heady bubble and also on those who live outside it. This outright stumper of a film embraces its campy, pulpy spirit with all its might as it satirizes society that is led by technology in directions that it cannot fully grasp, not as yet at nay rate. By the time LSD 3 happens, we will probably know better.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, LSD 2 raises questions, some playful, others pointed, even profound, about a world in which fake, nearly always, trumps fact. There is a heavy price to be paid for the surrender to the lure of constantly evolving technology, as the three principal characters in the film discover mostly at their own expense.\r\n\r\nWritten by director and co-producer Dibakar Banerjee with Prateek Vats and Shubham (the writers of Eeb Allay Ooo!), the Ekta Kapoor-produced LSD 2 repeats the three-part interlinked structure of LSD, which was made nearly a decade and a half ago and addressed the impact of recording devices that impinged on people's privacy and endangered their lives and mental well-being.\r\n\r\nIn the 14 years that have elapsed between the two films, both the hardware and the software have evolved to a point where the line between the real and the virtual, and the tangible and the deepfake, can be erased at the push of a button.\r\n\r\nGen Z appears to thrive on leading double lives but, as a result of the vanishing margins between the imagined and the factual, many are increasingly falling prey to manipulation and the danger of self-harm. That is the principal thematic burden of LSD 2 although it isn't in the least interested in telling the audience what to make of the plight of the people it is about.\r\n\r\nExploring gender fluidity in a manner that isn't remotely self-conscious, LSD 2 replaces the subheads of Love, Sex and Dhokha with Like, Share and Download. Each segment portrays the struggles of individuals trying to leap out of the boxes that a myopic society shoves them into, then slams the lid shut and keeps strict vigil on them.\r\n\r\nIn the first segment, a transwoman, Noor (Paritosh Tiwari), who aspires to be an acclaimed actress, is a participant in a garish reality show - it is called Truth Ya Naach. It requires her to put her life under the public spotlight. Noor goes on and off camera with an eye on higher ratings as her rivals snap at her heels and keep her on her toes.\r\n\r\nThe producers of the show - in the judges' seats are Sophie Chaudhry, Tusshar Kapoor and Anu Malik (the only one of the three who does not play himself) - manipulate her into a reunion with her estranged mother (Swaroopa Ghosh). The mother's first reaction on seeing Noor after a two-year hiatus is \"dublaa ho gaya hai\". She is still averse to accepting her altered sexual identity.\r\n\r\nAnu Malik's character throws a fit when the mother croons and the daughter dances to the song. Ordering the duo to stop, he thunders: \"Maa se badhkar kuch nahin hain\". He follows that up with a mushy ode to motherhood. It is apparent that his outburst is scripted. The ratings go through the roof and it is revealed that this bit of the show has been sponsored \"Maa Ki Mamta Aata (Mother's Love Flour).\r\n\r\nWith the ratings and the truth meter - a method to measure the veracity of statements that the participants make on the show - yo-yo-ing wildly, Noor is under constant pressure to 'perform' her transition for the consumption of the audience.\r\n\r\nHer process of gender assertion is reduced to a game controlled by the producers of the show, the sponsors, the public at large and, last but not the least, the anti-vulgarity clause in the rules that govern broadcasting. Technology and a society that is in voyeuristic mode 24/7, personal desire has been snatched away by the collective will of those whose ''likes\" can make or break the show.\r\n\r\nThe next part of LSD 2, too, has a third-gender character, Kulu (Bonita Rajpurohit), struggling with the consequences of being who she is. She is strapped for cash and unapologetic about using her body to earn her a few rupees more.\r\n\r\nKulu works on the cleaning team at a Metro Rail station in Delhi. Her boss, Lovina Singh (Swastika Mukherjee), single mother of a school-going boy (who turns out to be the link between this story and the next), feigns sympathy for her employee when she gets into serious trouble and is in danger of losing her job.\r\n\r\nUnder mounting pressure from the head honcho, Lovina does her best to control the damage that the negative publicity for her company - which seeks mileage out of giving employment to transgenders - but with every move that she makes she only succeeds in exposing her own and her firm's double standards.\r\n\r\nIt isn't only in the virtual world that things are phony. In fact, if things are fake in the images and claims that float around in a hyper-connected universe, they are only a reflection of all the pretence that is constantly sought to be passed off as fact.\r\n\r\nThat is exactly what 18-year-old school boy Shubham Narang (Abhinav Singh), Game Paapi in the virtual world, does in his avatar as a hyper-masculine dude. Artificial intelligence, virtual reality and metaverses have flip sides that extract a high price from those who play along and lose themselves in the dead-end algorithm-driven labyrinths.\r\n\r\nThe great thing about a Dibakar Banerjee film is that it never fails to spring surprises. LSD 2 has more than its share of fearless flights of fancy. Some land, some don't. But that takes little away. Even when it tends to be baffling, the film makes you think.\r\n\r\nIf that is the kind of cinema that excites you, LSD 2 might be well worth your time.",

    "content": " With 40-year-old actress Trisha playing a love interest to megastar Chiranjeevi in his upcoming film ‘Vishwambhara’, while 37-year-old glam diva Shruti Haasan scored another hit film ‘Salaar, it seems that age is just a number for glam/ divas in Tollywood. After Anushka Shetty returned with a bang with ‘Miss Shetty Mister Polishetty’, Kajal Agarwal tasted success with ‘Bhagavanth Kesari’. The craze for Samantha hasn’t subsided in Tollywood with plenty of offers, while Tamaannah is returning with ‘Chandrakala 4’. \"I think a few of these divas will be ruling the roost for a few more years considering their charm and popularity,\" says producer Vishnu Induri.\n\n Even though these actresses have crossed their prime age and running above 35 years, he explains, “Frankly, I don't think age is a factor for talented and experienced actresses. They are doing varied roles and trying out something different amidst their commercial movies and sustaining their rankings.\" He claims that glam divas would be part of big ticket entertainers for a long time in Tollywood.\n Recently, 39-year-old Anushka returned with a breezy entertainer 'Miss Shetty Mister Polishetty' to avoid being typecast as a heroine who loves to be flag-bearer of lady-oriented films. \"'Anushka has transcended varied barriers with her immense talent and she has proved her mettle in both star studded movies like 'Baahubali' and lady-oriented film 'Rudramadevi' Even other senior actresses are still in the reckoning by doing films with big stars like Chiranjeevi, Balakrishna and others,\" says director Hemanth Madhukar, who urges talented divas to explore both star-driven and women-oriented movies. \"They have to strike a proper balance between these two genres and extend their careers since they have gained their own fan following,\" he adds.Although Kajal Aggarwal is moving towards women-oriented movies with 'Satyabhama', producer Vishnu Induri says female-centric movies are finding it hard to get financers. \"Firstly, there are very few producers who like to bet their money on actresses and on the other hand, even a few divas are unwilling to shoulder the responsibility of carrying the film on their shoulders and they prefer to work with big stars. Just doing female-centric movies would cut down their film count so it's better to mix it up,\" he concludes.\n \n \n  \n \n\n",

    "content": " Ben & Jerry’s is a global ice cream brand, selling ice cream in several countries around the world. But in recent years, it has become much more than an ice cream company. Ben & Jerry’s has become embroiled in left-wing activism, campaigning on climate change, the war in Gaza, American culture wars, and more. \n\n Now, its chickens have come home to roost. Unilever, the consumer giant which owns Ben & Jerry’s, is dumping the brand. It was a long time coming, but Unilever’s patience with having to explain the ice cream brand’s political activism wore thin. Ben & Jerry’s ‘went woke’ and now it is heading out the door.\n\n\n Unilever will save a lot of money by ditching Ben & Jerry’s – around US$870 million, according to one estimate – but its reasons for getting out of the ice cream business run deeper than cash. Ben & Jerry’s has become impossible to control. Its management seems to relish courting controversy online by making outrageous political statements which even left-wing pundits disagree with, such as calling for the police to be defunded and for Mount Rushmore to be returned to indigenous Americans.\n Ben & Jerry’s put politics ahead of profit. To a sensible company like Unilever, that’s a recipe for disaster, so ditching this rebellious brand was inevitable. Ben & Jerry’s political activism was especially damaging because it was not limited to social media. It also bled over into the way the company is run. \n\n\n For example, as part of its climate activism, Ben & Jerry’s has sworn off palm oil. Palm oil is an ingredient used in countless food products, including many ice creams, but a subset of loud environmental campaigners claim it hurts the planet. As a result, Ben & Jerry’s refuses to use palm oil in its products and campaigns aggressively against it.\n\n\n Unfortunately, the truth is not on the side of these determined environmentalists. In reality, palm oil has strong environmental credentials. Even the WWF says its use can benefit the planet by, among other things, helping lower rates of deforestation. Instead of engaging constructively with this important discussion and throwing their weight behind sustainable palm oil production, Ben & Jerry’s chose sensationalism and grandstanding, furthering their reputation as purveyors of empty gestures.\n\n\n The rate of deforestation in places like Malaysia, which produces much of the world’s palm oil, have been trending lower for some time. A Global Forest Watch report from 2023 shows a sharp reduction in forest loss. Reversing deforestation is achievable. But Ben & Jerry’s doesn’t want to know because the truth undermines their political narrative.\n\n\n Initiatives employed by the Malaysian government and oil corporations are bearing fruit, with a whopping 83% of palm oil refining capacity now operating under a commitment to ‘no deforestation, peat and exploitation’ (NDPE). In other words, it’s perfectly possible to produce palm oil in an environmentally friendly way. A sensible ice cream business would have seen that. But Ben & Jerry’s stuck its flag in the ground with its anti-palm oil activism and refused to change its mind.\n\n\n Given the environmental benefits of using palm oil, why did Ben & Jerry’s stand so firmly stand against it? Because it presented another opportunity for online virtue-signalling. Yet again, they put their political posturing ahead of profit. In this case, their carelessness also ended up promoting harmful environmental messaging by undermining palm oil.\n There is a key lesson here for other brands to learn. Consumers do not want politics with their food, especially political activism which seems to thrive off online vitriol. Unilever is freeing itself of Ben & Jerry’s nonsense and won’t look back. \n \n\nDisclaimer: No Deccan Chronicle journalist was involved in creating this content.

Jagan Mohan Reddy was well-planned and those behind this incident should be exposed.\n\n \n  He launched the YSRC’s LED campaign vehicles on Thursday as part of the 2024 election campaign in Andhra Pradesh.\n  Launching the vehicles, the party general secretary said Jagan Reddy’s fans from the US have offered the campaign vehicles for free and the Challa Madhu team was coordinating and sending these vehicles for electioneering across the state.\n  These vehicles would publicise the welfare and other schemes of the YSRC government in various constituencies.\n  Ramakrishna Reddy said, “NRI friends from the US have provided 13 vehicles voluntarily for campaigning. People want another five years of Jagan rule, they like the welfare and development that happened in these five years.”\n  He said the SCs, STs, BCs and Minorities are thinking that Jagan's victory is their victory.\n  Regarding the stone attack on CM Jagan, Ramakrishna Reddy said, “We still call it a pre-planned attack, both of them (Jagan and MLA Velampalli Srinivas) were hit by that stone and injured. We are lucky that a big injury or incident was avoided.”\n  Responding to the description of the stone attack as a drama by Telugu Desam and Jana Sena, Ramakrishna Reddy challenged them to play the same drama if they have guts.\n  He refuted allegations of Naidu and other leaders of implicating TD candidate Bonda Uma in the stone attack in the Jagan case. “If there is a Bonda Uma roll, it will come out and if there are others including Chandrababu, it will also be revealed in the investigations.”\n  He stressed that there was evidence to show that the attack on the CM was pre-planned and there was no doubt that the attack was an assassination attempt.\n \n \n \n  \n \n\n",

Several of them proudly displayed the indelible mark and said they have completed their democratic duty.\n Authorities have ensured amenities like drinking water and 'pandal' to provide shade to voters who line up the serpentine queues.\n \n Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin, and his wife Durga Stalin cast their vote at a polling station here. Celebrities including Rajinikanth and Ilaiyaraaja were among the early voters.\n \n Leader of Opposition in the state assembly Edappadi K Palaniswami voted at a polling station in his home district of Salem.\n \n Argument broke out between voters and officials in some polling stations as authorities did not allow people to carry their smartphones/mobiles inside the booth. People belonging to Parandhur village with over 1,000 voters near Sriperumbudur did not turn up to vote till 9.30 AM. Residents of villages including Parandhur are opposing an airport project in their region.\n \n Voters arrived at the polling stations enthusiastically as early as 6.30 AM and waited for their turn to vote, with personnel of the state and central police forces standing guard. As many as 190 companies of Central Armed Police Forces have been deployed. Some polling stations like Kattuppalli (Tiruvallur) however wore a deserted look.\n \n Voting was delayed by an hour in some polling booths, such as the one near Tambaram coming under Sriperumbudur Lok Sabha segment, due to technical glitches in the electronic voting machines and officials said they were attending to it.\n \n Several voters who lined up the queues said they preferred to cast their votes early in the morning to avoid the 'scorching sun,' later in the day.\n \n In total, 3,32,233 polling personnel have been deployed and 1.3 lakh police personnel are on poll duty.\n \n The fate of 950 candidates will be decided by about 6.23 crore voters who are set to exercise their franchise in 68,321 polling stations.\n \n DMK's Dayanidhi Maran (Central Chennai), A Raja (Nilgiris) and Kanimozhi (Thoothukudi), BJP's K Annamalai (Coimbatore), L Murugan (Nilgiris) and Tamilisai Soundararajan (South Chennai), former Chief Minister O Panneerselvam (Ramanathapuram), Congress party's Karti Chidambaram (Sivaganga), AIADMK's J Jayavardhan (South Chennai) and AMMK chief TTV Dhinakaran (Theni) are among the prominent candidates.\n \n Political rivals Tamilisai Soundararajan and Premalatha Vijayakanth happened to meet at a polling booth in Saligramam here and hugged each other.

It is now time for voters to come and vote in large numbers at every polling station.\"\n \n Kumar said that it is essential for voters including women and youth to take part in the elections.\n \n \"We made an amendment in the Act where qualifying dates were made four instead of one - on January 1 of every year. There are a large number of young voters. There are voters who are transgenders. It's a truly inclusive voter list that has been prepared. The campaigning for the first phase is over. The silent period is over. Now this is the day of polling, the first one. It's for the voters to come, enjoy it at the polling station,\" he said.\n The CEC said that it's very enthusiastic to see young voters getting enrolled.\n \n \"We also did a lot of activities in the colleges and very youth-specific activities. We see a lot of enthusiasm. We have also done a lot of awareness-raising activities. So, if you keep using your finger on social media or on the phone the whole day, this is the time to spend five minutes and enjoy the power of voting at the polling station. Press the button on the electronic voting machine there. I'm sure this time our young voters are going to come ....we have appealed to them to become our ambassadors, to become our influencers,\" he said.\n \n \"Bring as many friends as possible including family members to the polling station. Enjoy the festival. Feel the responsibility of selecting and electing your own government,\" he added.\n \n Speaking on the ways to ensure the maximum participation of specially-abled and elderly people in the Lok Sabha election, the CEC said there is a facility for them to cast a vote from the comfort of their home.\n \"We have earmarked in our electoral rolls persons with disabilities, 40 per cent and above. There is a facility for them to cast a vote from the comfort of their home, if they so desire. But our experience is that many of them want to come to the polling station. And we provide them a volunteer, we provide them with wheelchairs, and it's not a question of physical comfort that we provide, it's a question of giving them the due respect and empowerment,\" he said.\n \n The Election Commission of India (ECI), for the first time in a Lok Sabha Election, has provided the facility of home voting for the elderly and Persons with Disabilities. Voters above 85 years of age and Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) with 40 per cent benchmark disability can avail the optional home voting facility. There are over 81 lakh 85+ aged voters and 90 lakh + PwD voters registered across the country.\n \n \"We have issued great guidelines to political parties to be very sensitive while talking about people with disabilities...they are more capable than most of us. It's a question of just giving them those opportunities,\" Kumar added.\n \n He also talked of ease of voting in Manipur which has seen ethnic violence.\n \"We have made a special scheme for voting in the camps. There are more than 18,000 people who have already registered with us to vote from the camps. Our teams will take their vote wherever they are. Our attempt was and is that nobody is disfranchised, everybody is given a chance to vote. Postal ballet, through camp...wherever. So we have done something, and I' am sure people will vote and establish the point that it's the ballot that gives the answers,\" he said.\n \n Informing about the ways to tackle muscle power, money, misinformation and Model Code of Conduct (MCC) violations, the CEC said that a large number of security and non-security measures are in place to ensure security and prevent violence.\n \n \"We are informing of all the steps we have taken to tackle the MCC violations and the money seizures done to the media and to everybody at large. So, everything is being reported and today is the day of voting.\"\n He said there are SSTs (strategic surveillance teams), FSTs (flying squad teams) apart from police personnel.\n \"A large number of security and non-security measures are in place. The only point is that people must come and vote. Whoever is listening, please come and vote. It's phase one, and there are six phases to come. Find out your polling station through our applications.We have distributed VIS (voter information slips),\" he said.\n \n \"More than 16 crore voter slips have been distributed in phase one. It's a kind of invitation that is reaching your house, saying this is your polling station. This is your voter list. Please come and vote. youth, male, female, old age, transgender, everybody we are looking for. Our staff is a very well trained. Teams are there at all the polling stations to welcome you very, very courteously.

    "content": " \n New Delhi: Voting for the first phase of Lok Sabha elections 2024 is progressing across 102 parliamentary constituencies spread over 21 states and Union Territories as the mega seven-phase electoral exercise commenced at 7:00 am.\n \n Voters will exercise their franchise until 6:00 pm.\n \n Polling for assembly elections in the north-eastern states of Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim also started along with voting for the first phase of Lok Sabha elections on Friday morning.\n \n Arunachal will be polling for two Lok Sabha seats and the 60-member Assembly. Apart from Arunachal, Sikkim will vote for 32 assembly seats and a lone Lok Sabha seat.\n \n Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking his third consecutive term, while the opposition bloc-INDIA- a coalition of opposing parties formed to take on the BJP in the general elections, is eyeing ousting him from power.\n The 2024 elections are taking place at a time when opposition leaders, including Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, have been arrested on charges of corruption in the liquor policy case.\n \n The opposition has alleged that they have been denied a level playing field, a charge denied by the ruling BJP. The Congress party also alleged that income tax authorities froze their accounts weeks before the elections and blamed the ruling party at the Centre.\n \n A total of 16.63 crore voters are going to vote in the first phase of Lok Sabha polls, deciding the fate of 1625 candidates, with Nitin Gadkari, Kiren Rijiju, Bhupendra Yadav, and Arjun Ram Meghwal among several Union ministers in the fray.\n \n According to the data released by the Election Commission of India (ECI), a total of 1.87 lakh polling stations have been set up, while 18 lakh personnel have been deployed across the 102 constituencies going to the polls.\n \n The first phase, with the highest number of parliamentary constituencies among all seven phases, will witness polling in 21 states and Union Territories.\n \n An estimated 8.4 crore male voters, 8.23 crore female voters, and 11,371 third-gender electors are eligible to vote in the first phase of Lok Sabha polls, according to the ECI data. Key issues ranging from unemployment, violence against women, long-pending grievances of farmers, paper leaks, land rights issues of tribal people, and a rise in prices are among the most debated across the country.\n \n A recent pre-poll survey by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) revealed that the foremost concerns for voters in India are price rises and unemployment. The plight of tea garden workers will have a say in Assam as estate workers demand better facilities and wages.\n Reportedly, health and education are also among the major demands raised by the estate workers. Assam will be voting in five Lok Sabha seats in the first phase out of the 14 constituencies. Inflation, farmers' issues, crimes against women, and paper leaks were among the most discussed in states including Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, among others.\n \n The pending full statehood took centre stage in the Union Territory of Puducherry.\n \n Tamil Nadu has demanded the proposed AIIMS, an exception from the NEET examination, and flood relief while awaiting the final verdict at the people's court.\n \n Manipur, which has seen violence and ethnic divide for almost a year, is also voting today, with ECI making special arrangements for internally displaced voters. Ahead of polling, women perform puja outside polling booth number 16 in Imphal.\n \n Manipur will hold two phases of elections for its parliamentary constituencies. The Inner Manipur constituency will go to the polls on April 19, while voting in the Outer Manipur constituency will be held for two days on April 19 and April 26.\n \n Nine special polling stations have been set up for the internally displaced people near a relief camp in Imphal East.\n \n The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has nominated Thounaojam Basanta Kumar Singh as its candidate for the Inner Manipur Lok Sabha seat, while the Indian National Congress has fielded Angomcha Bimol Akoijam.\n Chhattisgarh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Jammu and Kashmir, Lakshadweep, and Puducherry will be voting in the first phase.\n \n The north-eastern state of Nagaland faces numerous social and political challenges, including unemployment and inadequate healthcare facilities, as it prepares to vote for its sole seat.\n \n Improved tourism management, long-pending demands of sugarcane farmers, and enhanced environmental protection policies are among some of the key demands from Uttarakhand.\n \n Uttarakhand will be voting in five Lok Sabha seats. The economic woes of tea garden workers and Sandeshkhali are determining factors in West Bengal's three-seat poll in the first phase.\n \n To ensure 'peace and purity' in the biggest festival of democracy, the Election Commission has adequately deployed central forces at polling stations to secure the polling process.\n \n As per an ECI release, webcasting will be done in more than 50 per cent of the polling stations, along with the deployment of microobservers in all polling stations.A total of 4627 flying squads, 5208 statistics surveillance teams, 2028 video surveillance teams and 1255 video viewing teams are keeping surveillance round the clock to strictly and swiftly deal with any form of inducement of voters, the release mentioned.\n \n It further stated that a total of 1374 inter-state and 162 international border check posts are keeping a strict vigil on any illicit flow of liquor, drugs, cash and freebies. Also, strict surveillance has been kept on sea and air routes.The ECI has also warned the voters to guard against misinformation and fake news from influencing them or dissuading them from participating in these elections, especially against false narratives being peddled on social media.\n \n In 2019, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) won 45 of the 102 seats that will go to the polls on Friday in the first phase, while the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won 42 seats.\n \n The second phase will be held on April 26 and the remaining phases will be May 7, May 13, May 20, May 25 and June 1 accordingly.\n \n The last general elections in 2019 were also held in seven phases.\n The poll schedule was announced by the Election Commission of India on March 16. Bye-elections to 26 assembly constituencies will also be held alongside the Lok Sabha and four state assembly polls.\n\n",

Raghunandan Rao, who filed his nomination papers. \n \n Sawant spoke about the welfare of women, youth and farmers which, he said, had a special focus in BJP's manifesto.\n \n “It was Modi who gave 33 per cent reservation to women (yet to be implemented) and also implemented welfare measures such as the construction of toilets, housing for poor, supply of electricity and supply of water under 'Har Ghar Jal' scheme,” he said.\n \n Referring to the NDA government's schemes for youth, including Mudra loans and Start-up India, he said Modi should be made PM for a third term to ensure the development of the schemes.\n \n Sawant, who also talked about the other schemes and welfare measures such as 'Kisan Samman Nidhi' and free ration, said the people have only seen the “trailer” during the 10-year rule of Modi.\n \n  “Picture abhi baaki hai' (the picture is still pending),” he said, emphasising the BJP's promises of Uniform Civil Code (UCC), 'One Nation, One Election' and the welfare of all sections of society.\n \n “BRS “looted” Telangana for 10 years and Congress is “looting” now and they should be “sent home” in the Lok Sabha elections,” he said.\n \n The process of filing nominations began in Telangana on Thursday. Polling would be held for all 17 LS seats in Telangana on May 13.\n \n Speaking on the occasion, TS BJP president and Union minister G. Kishan Reddy referred to BRS president K. Chandrashekar Rao's reported comments that a false case has been made against his daughter and BRS MLC K. Kavitha, and said the BJP does not need to register a false case. Rao and his daughter hurt the prestige of Telangana people, he alleged.\n\n",

While the opposition BRS and the BJP declared candidates for all the 17 Lok Sabha seats long ago, and the BJP candidates began filing their nomination papers, the Congress high command was still adopting a wait-and-watch policy giving anxious moments to party leaders and cadre in Telangana state.\nThere is no clarity when the AICC's central election committee (CEC) will meet in Delhi to finalise candidates for these three seats.\n'Caste equations' are said to be delaying the selection of candidates for Khammam and Karimnagar. The buzz in party circles is that the high command is of the view that if the ticket is allotted to a Reddy or any candidate from general categories in Khammam, the Karimnagar seat should be allotted to a candidate from Backward Castes and vice versa.\nIn Khammam, Reddy and Raju candidates are in the race along with Mala. In Karimnagar, Reddy and BC candidates are in the race.\nDeputy CM Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka and minister Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy are strongly lobbying for tickets to their family members from Khammam, while minister Ponnam Prabhakar is lobbying for his supporters in Karimnagar.\nThe party high command is reportedly not taking the Hyderabad Lok Sabha seat seriously as part of 'understanding' with the AIMIM.

It is very unfortunate on the part of Congress to insult such a noble deed,” he said.\nStating that it is foolish to think that the Congress with its current strength would get 300 Lok Sabha seats to come into power, Rajendar said only the BJP could build infrastructure, bring industries and Metro Rail to the Cantonment and other areas of the Malkajgiri Lok Sabha constituency, from where he is contesting.\nClaiming that he had direct access to Modi and defence minister Rajnath Singh and could resolve the grievances of ex-servicemen, Rajendar said BRS chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao never took the initiative to provide the land sites to poor ex-servicemen.\nStating that the Jammu and Kashmir would emerge as another Switzerland after Modi abrogated Article 370, Rajendar said Modi allowed the soldiers at the border to respond as per the situation warrants to protect the land unlike waiting for nod in earlier Congress governments.\n“From the days of importing arms, India has emerged as a powerful nation and indigenously developing the arms under the Make in India programme. The reputation of the country has improved and countries like Ukraine and Russia are looking towards India to stop the war,” he said.\nRajendar was presented with a ‘veterans’ cap’ by ex-servicemen. Defence minister was supposed to attend the meeting nut arrived late. Rajnath Singh was received by the BJP OBC Morcha national president Dr K. Laxman and former BJP MLC N. Ramchander Rao.",

This was after a series of discussions between top BJP and other leaders, including Amit Shah and J.P. Nadda. However, this meant the hopefuls in the TD had to sacrifice their interests in some constituencies.\n Though the TD officially announced its nominee Pyla Prasad at Madugula in Anakapalli Lok Sabha segment, a proposal is on to replace him with Bandaru Satyanarayana.\n TD chief Naidu, during his recent visit to north Andhra districts, lashed out at Bandaru for seeking the seat and even threatening to switch loyalty to another party. There is also a proposal vis-a-vis the Anaparthy Assembly segment to replace BJP’s nominee M. Shiva Krishnam Raju to accommodate TD’s Nallamilli Ramakrishna Reddy.\n As for the Denduluru Assembly segment, there is a proposal to replace TD’s official nominee Chinthamaneni Prabhakar with BJP candidate Garapati Seetaramanjaneya Chowdary. There seems to be no adjustment of seats except to force the official nominee to forfeit his allotted seat.\n Similarly, the Undi Assembly segment is also facing trouble as there are two more contestants in addition to the existing official nominee from TD and sitting MLA Manthena Rama Raju.\n Vetukuri Venkata Siva Rama Raju won the segment for two terms in 2009 and 2014. Raju intends to contest as an independent candidate in the upcoming polls.\n There is a proposal to accommodate K. Raghu Rama Krishna Raju from TD in the Undi Assembly segment by replacing the existing candidate, as Raju joined the TD recently in the presence of party chief Naidu.\n Political analysts say TD chief is in the habit of making last-minute changes of nominees, until the last date for filing of nominations. Some of those who have been accommodated are yet to get active on the campaign front, for fear that Naidu could change his mind at any time.\n\n",

Overall, Chandrababu Naidu did much less for underprivileged during his 14 years’ rule, compared with what Jagan Mohan Reddy did.”\n The waiting people were disappointed when they were informed that Jagan Mohan Reddy was not going to address them at Devi Chowk Centre.\n One of them, K. Sai, said, “YSRC would win the polls mainly because of the welfare schemes and developmental works.”\n A section of the waiting youth were seen lustily cheering and dancing to the tunes of songs being played during Jagan Mohan Reddy’s visit to the city.\n At one point, the CM stepped down from his vehicle to talk to a family that came to meet him in an ambulance seeking help for an accident survivor. The CM talked to the patient and promised necessary help, at Madiki village.\n Former minister Indukuri Ramakrishnan Raju met the CM at Tetali stay point.\n AP Chamber of Commerce convener from Tadepalligudem, Ganinin Subba Rao joined the YSRC.\n Several other leaders including MRPS founder president U. Brahmadiha Madiga, Madiga Maha Sena president Prem Kumar, AP Human Rights Commission’s former member G, Srinivas, Madiga Intellectual Forum representative G. Bapiraj and Dalit Sena representative Ravi Prakash met the CM.\n\n",

    "content": " ANANTAPUR: A Kadapa district court on Thursday issued ad-interim injunction and instructed leaders of the Opposition not to make any mention of the Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy murder case — now with the CBI court — during the ongoing election campaign.\n\n This followed a petition by YSRC Kadapa district president K. Suresh Babu.\n The Opposition parties including APCC chief Y.S. Sharmila and Vivekananda Reddy’s daughter Dr Suneetha Nareddy along with TD, JS and BJP leaders were “blaming and defaming Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and Kadapa MP Y.S. Avinash Reddy, by citing this case,” the petitioner complained.\n Kadapa Principal District Judge G. Sreedevi issued the ad-interim injunction orders.\n The YSRC leader, in his petition, mentioned seven persons — N. Chandrababu Naidu and Nara Lokesh of the TD, Pawan Kalyan of the Jana Sena, APCC chief Y.S. Sharmila, Vivekananda Reddy’s daughter Dr Narreddy Suneetha, BJP state chief D. Purandeswari and Pulivendula TD candidate Ravindranath Reddy (B. Tech Ravi) – who were “accusing even the CM though he was in no way connected to the case.”\n The court emphasised that such accusations were prejudicial to the ongoing legal proceedings and violated the fundamental principles of justice.\n The court's decision followed an analysis of the documents filed by the petitioners/plaintiffs, particularly videos and newspaper cuttings from social media platforms, print and electronic media.\n It was observed unsubstantiated claims were being made on Avinash Reddy's alleged involvement in the murder of his uncle Vivekananda Reddy, and there were accusations of the Chief Minister shielding him.\n “This court is of considered opinion that when a case is pending before a competent court for adjudication, no one is entitled to step into the shoes of the court with no authorisation and give their verdict and term any of the persons so involved in such case as murderer/guilty person according to their whims and fancies.” the court stated.\n The court highlighted concerns regarding the interference of political parties and media in legal matters, stating that they have assumed the role of a 'public court' (janata adalat), thereby “jeopardising the presumption of innocence until proven guilty and the principle of 'guilt beyond reasonable doubt'.”\n The court warned against the dangers of media trials and underscored the importance of upholding the integrity of the justice system.\n As the Vivekananda Reddy murder case is pending before the CBI court in Nampally, the Kadapa district court restrained any propagation labelling Avinash Reddy as the murderer of his uncle and any assertions regarding Jagan Mohan Reddy “shielding him through any medium,” including print, electronic, and social media platforms.\n The respondents/defendants were directed to remove objectionable remarks made against the YSRC, Jagan Mohan Reddy and Avinash Reddy from electronic and social media platforms immediately.\n They were also instructed to refrain from personal attacks or criticisms based on allegations or distortions regarding pending cases in competent courts of law, adhering strictly to the prevailing Election Code of Conduct in AP as issued by the Election Commission.\n This ad-interim injunction will remain in force until April 30.\n\n",

    "content": " Be it a democracy or a dictatorship, governments are almost always changed by throwing out the incumbent. The former is called a democratic transition and the latter is inevitably a revolution. Even if it is, as usually is the case, more of the same. \n\n India’s electoral process that begins on April 19 will be concluded on June 4 when the results are announced. Most psephologists, commentators, astrologers and bazar gossips are sanguine that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be easily re-elected to a third successive term. I do not agree with that sanguinity. \n I think Mr Modi has a hard hill to climb and the slope may be too steep and slippery for him. Look at the objective reality. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats or almost 56 per cent of the Lok Sabha with 37.4 per cent of the popular vote. This skew is how it usually is in a first-past-the-post system. Even a minority mandate translates into an overwhelming outcome. But the problem with the BJP mandate is that it is concentrated in a minority of states. The saffron mandate is restricted almost entirely to the large Hindi-speaking states (202/235), as well as Maharashtra (41/48) and Karnataka (25/28). It got 268 out of its 303 in just this concentration. Winning these states is not the issue for the BJP. Repeating this performance is. \n The BJP governments in these states have not exactly covered themselves with glory. The party got resoundingly thrashed in the recent state elections in Karnataka, where Mr Modi fully deployed his mind spread and headgears, turning it into a Modi versus Congress contest. In the years after 2014, the BJP has turned every election, including for municipal councils, into a Modi versus the rest contest. It has lost many of these. For Prime Minister Modi to repeat 2019, we have to assume that the electorate is able to selectively choose Mr Modi for Parliament and not for the Assemblies. \n But a lot of murky waters have flowed down the Ganga, the Narmada and Godavari since 2019. The effects of demonetisation (2016), the Covid-19 lockdowns and general mismanagement have set India on a much lower growth trajectory than the one it was between 2004 and 2014. In that decade India’s GDP grew from $721 billion to $2.03 trillion, or an increase of 182 per cent; while in 2024 it grew to $3.75 trillion from $2.03 trillion, or by 86.6 per cent. But lower growth has not slowed down the accumulation of wealth with the upper class. Income inequality is among the highest in the world now. At the end of 2022, the wealth Gini coefficient of India stood at 82.3, a significant increase compared to 74.7 in 2000. \n Joblessness and job dissatisfaction have grown to dominate our economic and social landscape. The ILO’s “India Employment Report 2024” paints a bleak outlook for the 7-8 million youth being added to the labour force each year, with youth accounting for almost 83 per cent of India’s unemployed workforce. Even more distressing is that among the unemployed, the proportion of educated young people, those who have had a secondary-level education or higher, has doubled to 65.7 per cent now from 35.2 per cent in 2000. Unemployed graduates (29.1%) outnumber illiterates (3.4%) by nine times. This underscores the shortage of jobs requiring skills and education. \n The peasantry is disaffected and has taken to the highways again. While the Jat peasantry of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh fattened on assured MSP and near 100 per cent procurement wants more, the peasantry in the rest of the country chaffs at state regulations to control prices and hence restrict their incomes. The fragmentation of land holdings has only added to farmer discontent. Ironically, it is widespread even among those who get all and those who get little. \n That this general mood will not affect Mr Modi’s standing in the saffron belt even somewhat, despite a half-constructed temple in Ayodhya, is to be excessively hopeful. People are natural repositories of discontent. Even after Lord Ram returned to Ayodhya it didn’t take people too long to raise uncomfortable questions and Queen Sita had to seek refuge in Valmiki’s ashram. \n Mr Modi has to deal with discontent and in all likelihood there will be attrition. In each of the saffron states, the BJP won in 2019 with well over 50 per cent of the popular vote. In Gujarat, it polled as much as 62 per cent, in UP it currently holds 64 seats with 49.56 per cent, and in MP and Rajasthan it had over 58 per cent each. Only in Assam did the BJP do well (9/12) with only 36 per cent of the vote. Even in West Bengal, where Mr Modi waged a vicious and personalised campaign against Mamata Banerjee to win 18 seats, it won 40 per cent. The picture is clear, there is too little room to climb higher, while a drop could be very precipitous in terms of seats. \n Presuming Mr Modi will lose support in the BJP’s existing strongholds, where can it hope to make up for the losses? Let's start from the South. It is very unlikely to gain any seats in Tamil Nadu and Kerala -- meaning zero will remain zero. It has 25 out of 28 in Karnataka, which is unlikely to be repeated. The Congress is expected to make strong gains here. The BJP has a recently cobbled up an alliance with the TDP, which could mean a couple of seats in Andhra Pradesh. It has four in Telangana and is unlikely to add to it. Thus, even a 10 per cent loss in seats in the saffron heartland and a further loss of, say 10-15 in Karnataka, will leave it well below the halfway mark. Along with its on and off ally, the JD(U), the BJP won 39/40 in Bihar. With the RJD resurgent and a settled alliance with the Congress, that record is unlikely to be maintained. The INDIA alliance is tipped to easily do double digits or even 50 per cent of the seats in Bihar. The AAP/Congress alliance might sweep Delhi’s seven seats. The saffron alliance won 41/48 in Maharashtra. With every party split in the state and with an uninspiring state leadership, Mr Modi alone may not be able to pull all the chestnuts out of the fire. \n Spread it on a spreadsheet and see how the cookie crumbles. It doesn’t look like the BJP is anywhere near 400. Even the halfway mark of 272 looks like a hard climb. \n   \n\n",

    "content": " The world is waiting to see what Israel would do in retaliation for the large-scale strike that Iran carried out from its soil last weekend. Even before the 300 projectiles in the form of drones and missiles came at it from Iran, Israel’s war cabinet, having US intelligence at hand on an impending strike, had ordered the military to draw up plans for wide-ranging attacks against Iran. \n\n Now, as Israel bides its time, pressure has built up for restraint, especially because the Iran assault came to virtually nothing in terms of human damage — one child was hurt by shrapnel — as Israel’s Iron Dome stood up to a litmus test of defence and the US and even Arab nation Jordan shot down Iranian missiles and drones in the air. \n It is now up to the Joe Biden-led West to hold Israel back from any misadventure that could sharply escalate the West Asia conflict into a big regional war, as Iran is unlikely to take direct hits without striking back even if it drew some derision for its missiles being unable to inflict any pain on Israel, with social media posts suggesting that people died only from laughter at the ineffectiveness of a wide-ranging attack. \n For Benjamin Netanyahu, the beleaguered Israeli Prime Minister who is facing protests at home from tens of thousands of people calling for fresh elections and by that his exit, which is said to be guaranteed given his unpopularity anywhere outside his war cabinet, sitting out after Israel being hit cannot be for too long. Therein lies the danger as the Israeli PM’s decision, with a question of his survival as a politician, could put the region and the world in danger. \n When Israel launched the operation in Damascus to strike a building belonging to the Iranian embassy in Syria and get at top commanders including Mohammad Reza Zahedi, the commander for Syria and Lebanon of Iran’s elite Quds Force, a branch of Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, it did not inform US of its plans until the very last moment. \n Having put off its operations plans for Rafah in the Gaza Strip after the Iran strike, Israel can be said to be in a quiet contemplative phase. If restraint somehow keeps occupying its thinking, there might just be a chance for restoring peace in the Middle Eastern cauldron. \n   \n\n",

    "content": " Indians will start their long march to elect the 18th Lok Sabha and to decide whether a government should be given a chance a third time with voters in 102 of the 543 Lok Sabha constituencies voting today. As many as 21 states and Union territories will be involved in the first of the seven-phase exercise. \n\n The battle lines have been drawn in a much better fashion this time than they were in the 2019 election. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, would look emaciated numerically with several allies leaving it in the meantime but its core structure and ideological strength remain intact. The Opposition platform has got a better shape this time with the formation of the Indian National Democratic Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) bloc with 41 parties, though it also has experienced its early shocks with the defection of the JD(U), one of its founding members. Another major participant, the Trinamul Congress, is fighting the elections on its own, even while remaining part of the platform. \n The NDA started its campaign propelled by Mr Modi and his guarantees related to the economy and social welfare but soon shifted gears and brazenly embraced Hindutva. Incessant attacks on the Opposition leaders on their absence at the consecration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya have been a pet theme of the BJP leaders including Mr Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah; they even asked people to punish the Opposition for this so-called “sin”.  \n The party was on the defensive after the revelations related to electoral bonds dented the credibility of its anti-corruption posturing. The fear of repercussions after the arrest of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal could also have contributed to its worries, forcing it to go back to the Hindutva theme. Given that the BJP has the best organisational machinery and can boast of some of the most efficient communicators in its ranks, the NDA still remains confident. \n The INDIA bloc which wasted precious time fighting the October-November Assembly elections as a divided entity learned some bitter lessons and has been able to put up a united front against the NDA in most key states for the Lok Sabha polls. The Congress indeed took the leadership in cobbling the alliance together, and save in West Bengal and Punjab, INDIA bloc partners are in harmony. That the NDA will be facing a united Opposition in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra could make the electoral battle an interesting one. \n The Election Commission of India has quite the task on its hand. It has kept up its vigil against practices that have an impact on the electoral process. That the enforcement agencies have made a record seizure of Rs 4,650 crores in cash points to the alertness of the system, though it will be an insignificant portion of the real sum involved. What, however, bothers the advocates of fair elections is the inaction on the part of the EC against political leaders who in flagrant violation of the law and the Model Code of Conduct, canvass votes in the name of religion. The ECI must stand firm against all forces that vitiate the entire process and wreck the idea of a level playing field. We demand a free and fair election. \n   \n\n",

While not everyone can commit to full-time social work, just a few hours of voluntary service in a week can make a significant difference in society. \n Benefits Of Benevolence \n Even helping in a small way can make a real difference in the lives of people, animals, and the environment. Volunteering is a two-way street: It can benefit the volunteer besides the cause they choose to help. Young people become more understanding, sensitive, and patient and develop social and leadership skills. It can reduce stress, keep you mentally stimulated, provide a sense of purpose, and improve health. Dr Mamta Jain, a psychologist and social educator from Hyderabad says that doing good for someone is a noble act. Physical, financial, or emotional help are different domains, in which one can help others. “Doing good unconditionally and without expectations helps improve mental health. Listening patiently to someone who is in distress, taking care of an unwell roommate in a hostel, etc “small or big” good acts improve brain chemistry, related to chemicals known as neurotransmitters and hormones that stimulate certain areas of the brain. Acts of kindness boost � dopamine that can give us feelings of happiness. Being good improves mental health and results in satisfaction and happiness as a reward,” Dr Mamta says. Let us meet a few young people who are in their 20s and doing their bit to make the world a better place. These youth give hope that there is a scope to change the way our society functions, and if everyone starts doing small acts of kindness, we are on the way to being a happier world. \n Young Lifesavers \n There is a huge deficit in the demand and supply of blood in India. To bridge this gap, voluntary donation promotion is the only way out. Blood donations can save many lives. Patients with cancer, anaemia, and thalassemia, require blood frequently. Keerthi Reddy Gade (24), a software engineer from Hyderabad believes in creating awareness about blood donations. Since 2018, Keerti has been spreading the message of blood donation physically and via social media. Keerthi also helps in organising blood donation camps. “For the first time, when I got my phone during B Tech 1-st year, I learned about blood donation camps and blood requests from a group. That led me to support this cause. I joined as a volunteer in the NGO Aasya Foundation.” Despite her post-graduation and busy job schedule, she devotes 4-7 hours on weekends to social work. “I try to get donors' numbers and give them to needy people. I have helped the college in organising blood donation camps too.” Besides blood donation, Keerthi has been involved in beach cleaning activities and visits orphanages and old age homes with other volunteers of an NGO, raising funds for donations of groceries, books, and clothes. \n “Doing good unconditionally and without expectations helps improve mental health.”— Dr Mamta Jain, psychologist and social educator, Hyderabad  \n “I try to get donors' numbers and give them to needy people. I have helped the college in organising blood donation camps too.”— Keerthi Reddy Gade, software engineer, Hyderabad \n • Shah Rukh Khan’s Meer Foundation protects and empowers women and provides support and rehabilitation for female victims of crime, particularly acid attacks in India. SRK has donated around $25,000 toward relief provisions after a flood in Kerala in 2018 and during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Meer Foundation donated 2,000 PPE kits to front-line workers. \n • Deepika Padukone’s Live Love Laugh (LLL) foundation creates awareness about mental health, reduces the stigma associated with mental illness, and offers mental health resources. LLL’s programmes are conducted through partnerships and allow people to use the platform to request mental health counselling or find a credible therapist. \n • Rajkummar Rao participates in a beach cleanup initiative post-Ganpati Visarjan at Juhu Beach. He had led the cleanliness drive at Mangrove Forest and posted on social media saying: “It was such a gratifying experience to clean the mangrove forest at Arioli Creek this morning along with the @incometax. mumbai. gov.in #Swachhata HiSeva @narendramodi ji.” \n • Sonu Sood became a household name during the pandemic for his philanthropic work. He helped migrant labourers reach their hometowns during the pandemic. He has the Sood Charity Foundation which does several humanitarian works. \n • Hrithik Roshan donated blood in 2022 saying: “I was told that my blood group B-negative is a rare type. Hospitals often fall short of it. Pledging to be an insignificant part of the very significant blood bank.” \n • Salman Khan’s Being Human (NGO) provides education and healthcare to underprivileged children. During the pandemic, Salman gave Rs 1,500 each to approximately 25,000 Bollywood workers who were without employment due to the lockdown. He has often paid hospital bills for the needy. In 2020, Aashiqui actor Rahul Roy suffered a brain stroke. Salman helped him financially during this difficult time. \n Generous Fundraisers \n Whether it is volunteering, donating, or just being supportive to those in need, every little bit counts Ananya Purohit (20) Mumbai, currently pursuing an internship believes that not everyone may be able to commit to full-time social work, there are countless ways young people contribute to positive change in society, through volunteering, advocacy, or leveraging their social media networks for good. “My family has instilled in me empathy, compassion, and the need to act for desired change in society. Seeing the impact of initiatives like ‘Ayesha’ undertaken by my college committee has been eye-opening. Over the past two years, ‘Ayesha’ has made a difference in the lives of many needy providing food grains, and support to underprivileged communities. I, along with my team, raised around Rs 80,000 from students, staff, and other citizens to donate essential food grains in a village.” Ananya feels that by harnessing the energy and enthusiasm of young people, we can raise awareness about important issues, and mobilize support for meaningful causes. \n Animal Welfare \n Animals deserve our love and care. Animal welfare is an important cause in India. Siddhanth Gill (27) director, Marketing, Naarad PR and Image Strategists takes care of maimed abandoned and abused dogs and cats. Siddhanth’s family has always been sensitive towards animals and he has inherited this love for animals from his grandparents and mother (who is an animal activist). The family cares for orphaned dogs and cats. Whether they are tiny kittens found on the streets or injured rescued puppies offering them a second chance at life. His home has many canine and feline companions and they provide them with the love and medical care they need. “I have 13 dogs and over 60 cats at home. People come and leave their pets knowing that we will take care of them. Recently a man had abandoned the dog but she used to find her way back home. So, he put her in the car dickey to die for three days. Then someone helped the dog (named Fox) and it came to us. Today Fox is enjoying life in her old age in our home. Then we have Jerry and Appam who rose from death and gastroenteritis. TP, a dog who was blinded by a sharp object on the streets and left to die, the list goes on. But once the dogs and cats come home, they are safe and happy. And seeing them healthy and safe makes me feel very happy.” Siddhanth’s day begins with a generous dose of licks and purrs. His brother Vedant takes care of the vet part while he takes care of the feeding and grooming along with a helper. “Our vets are amazing. They always guide us. If you love something or someone enough, you will always find the time. And for family, there is always time,” he says. \n “People come and leave their pets knowing that we will take care of them.”— Siddhanth Gill, director (Marketing) Naarad PR and Image Strategists \n Collective Efforts \n Nivan V Sadh (20) has been doing voluntary work since class 12th. In 2021, during his first year in college, he founded a student-run initiative called ‘Garuda Cell’ on campus to mobilize students towards social service. It became the official social service wing of ‘Think India HRC,’ a collective group of students from HR College for skill education and national socio-economic awareness. The first beach clean-up at Dadar post-lockdown had over 100 students participating in it. They raised awareness of water pollution and waste management. “We have been lucky to get support from NGOs and resident groups for financial help. Today, the student body I founded has over 100 active students that work almost daily to plan, execute, and fund the social service activities lined up in the coming weeks and months,” says Nivan, who has completed his final BMS year examinations from H.R. College of Commerce and Economics Mumbai. Currently, he works as an intern in the office of Milind Deora, Rajya Sabha MP. The recent project – ‘Sakhi’ used crowdfunding to provide sanitary napkins to underprivileged girls in Maharashtra. He says, “We managed to collect enough to provide reusable sanitary napkins to 100 impoverished households that did not have access to menstrual hygiene. Students and their parents gave us financial support.” While Nivan had the advantage of being brought up in a relatively privileged family, it was often disturbing for him to see the conditions of people living in underprivileged areas, and that motivated him to do voluntary work. “The smiles on the faces of people who I help inspire me. It is easy to manage studies with something you are passionate about, which in my case is social service. I have conducted over 30 social service activities in the last three years as a part of the student body,” he says. \n “The student body I founded has over 100 active students that work almost daily to plan, execute, and fund the social service activities.” — Nivan V Sadh, founder, Garuda Cell \n",

    "content": "  \n Languages are the threads that weave people into diverse traditions and cultures. Regional, state, or indigenous languages convey ancestral roots and show India’s diversity. However, many indigenous languages spoken by the natives and the tribal community are on the brink of extinction. The UNESCO’s 2018 report underscores 42 indigenous languages as critically endangered. Rapid urbanisation and the pressure to embrace regional languages for livelihood have taken a toll on the dialects spoken by indigenous communities. But efforts are being made to revive some of these ancestral ‘gifts of tongues’ through teaching, integrating endangered languages into curriculums, and raising awareness of indigenous art. Many linguists from across India and abroad are toiling to preserve India's rich linguistic heritage.  \n Lost In Translation  \n Nearly 6,700 different languages are spoken around the world. India is home to over 19,500 languages and dialects spoken as mother tongues according to the 2018 census data. Sadly, over the past 60 years, around 250 languages have gone extinct according to various language experts. Ganesh Narayandas Devy, a renowned cultural activist, linguist and founder of the People’s Linguistic Survey Of India found that out of the 780 languages spoken, 400 are at risk of dying in the next 50 years. Prof. Ganesh Devy speaks about the main factors behind dying languages in India. “Due to uneven economic development and social injustice, the livelihood opportunities for people in their ‘own’ language are unavailable. These people are forced to migrate out of their language home to obtain livelihood with no inflow of others picking up the language.” Languages like Tai Ahom, Andro, Rangkas, Sengmai, Tolcha which were all spoken in the Himalayan belt have gone extinct. The Bo language in Andaman and the Majhi language in Sikkim disappeared as recently as 2010 and 2015. “Indigenous communities find it difficult to pass on their language wisdom to the next generation as speakers of these languages are viewed as inferior. “With the dissolution of language, social bonds weaken, making room for modern socialisation,” adds Prof Ganesh Devy. Dr Arup Kumar Nath from the Department of Linguistics and Language Technology, Tezpur University says, “Almost all languages lack their indigenous writing system or script. The existing system of education does not put much emphasis on orality with very little documentation done.”  \n Reviving Lost Voices \n The revival efforts for indigenous languages have sparked much-needed discussions on saving and safeguarding the cultural diversity of India. Speakers of native indigenous languages are introducing indigenous languages in educational curriculums and teaching the youth to learn and speak a native language. Dr. Palash Kumar Nath, a linguist and multilingual education practitioner from Assam, India started the Singpho Mother Tongue School in Ketetong village of North East India where school children were given story books and cultural knowledge in the Singpho script. Similarly, non-profit organisations like the Samskrita Bharati are reviving spoken and written Sanskrit in India. UNESCO is reviving indigenous languages through digital initiatives that promote preservation, revitalization, and promotion. One of the main pioneers for reviving the indigenous languages in Odisha is Dr Mahendra Mishra an eminent linguist and folklorist. Being the first Indian to receive the International Mother Language Award from UNESCO in 2023 Dr Mahendra has worked on reviving 21 tribal languages in a span of 15 years. Speaking about his journey in reviving indigenous languages in Odisha he says “Many tribal children face the challenge of their home language differing from the language of instruction which created a barrier to understanding for tribal children.” In Odisha out of 62 tribes, 32 tribes have lost their home language completely due to assimilation with the commonly spoken Odia language. By incorporating tribal languages, songs, and customs into the teaching methods and curriculum, they bridged the gap between home and school languages. “Through bilingual education, both tribal and non-tribal teachers excelled in connecting with students, mitigating the language barrier effectively,” adds Dr Mahendra.  \n The Way Forward \n The Indian government has undertaken significant efforts to revive indigenous languages and preserve linguistic diversity. Some of the initiatives include the inclusion of indigenous languages in educational curricula, the establishment of language revitalization programmes, and the support of community-led language preservation projects. Dr Arup Kumar Nath speaks of how individuals can contribute towards reviving indigenous languages in India.  \n “Sensitisation and promotion on digital platforms will immensely help the native speakers of these languages to maintain their languages. Community members should try to evolve a language economy which can help engage some people in practising and studying their languages,” he says.  \n Promoting pride in indigenous cultural heritage and encouraging intergenerational transmission of language and traditions can help ensure the survival and vitality of indigenous languages in India. \n Language Trouble \n 6,700 different languages are spoken around the world \n 19,500 languages and dialects in India  \n 197 languages in India are endangered \n 42 Indian languages are critically endangered (more than any country in the world [UNESCO] \n 40% of indigenous languages spoken around the world are in danger (UN) \n By incorporating tribal languages, songs, and customs into the teaching methods and curriculum, we bridged the gap between home and school languages.” — Dr Mahendra Mishra, Linguist, Folklorist and UNESCO Award Winner \n Voice Check \n • Tai Nora and Tai Roga [Assam], Nihali [Maharashtra], Walmiki and Malhar [Andhra Pradesh], Koraga [Karnataka] and Gondi [Telangana] are on the verge of extinction \n • Few Siddis, an African-descendant group near Murud Janjira Fort speak African languages \n • People from Mahe, Yanam, and Karaikal in Pondicherry speak in the Indian French dialect \n • Only 12,000 people in Goa speak Portuguese as a first language in the Salcete and Mormugão regions \n Sensitisation and promotion on digital platforms will immensely help the native speakers of these languages to maintain their languages.” — Dr Arup Kumar Nath, Department of Linguistics, Tezpur University  \n Due to uneven economic development and lack of livelihood opportunities in one’s own language, people are forced to migrate out of their language homes.” — Prof. Ganesh Narayandas Devy, Cultural activist, Linguist, Founder of PLSI \n",

(Photo: PTI)SCCL is a government coal mining company jointly owned by the government of Telangana and the Centre on a 51:49 equity basis. (Photo: PTI) \n Chennai: General elections in the first half of the year may impact demand for mining and construction equipment.  \n The sales volumes of the domestic mining and construction equipment industry are estimated to decline in FY2025 following two consecutive years of strong growth. Against 26 per cent growth in FY23 and 24 per cent in FY2024, ICRA expects a 12 to 15 per cent decline in sales in FY25. This could translate into volumes of 1.14-1.18 lakh units in FY25. \n The reversal in this growth trend will be driven by a slowdown in the new project award activity in Q4 FY2024 and Q1 FY2025, as the Model Code of Conduct will remain in force during the Parliamentary Elections in April-May 2024.  \n Further, the project awarding activity has seen a disruption in the past two quarters. “Pre-election push on project execution by the Government created a strong demand momentum for the MCE industry in the last two years. However, with a likely disruption in project award activity for two consecutive quarters for Q4 FY2024 and Q1 FY2025 amidst the Parliamentary Elections and monsoon-related impact on construction activities in Q2, H1 FY2025 is expected to see a moderation in sales,” Ritu Goswami, Sector Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA.  \n However, the volumes are expected to ramp up in H2, given the pick-up in new project awards starting Q3 and partly supported by pre-buying due to the CEV-V emission norm transition in January 2025.  \n While the near-term domestic MCE demand environment remains challenging, the industry’s long-term prospects remain intact, given the continued government focus on infrastructure development.  \n",

    "content": " Hyderabad: Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy on Thursday said the Congress-led INDIA bloc will win 115 Lok Sabha seats out of the 130 in the southern states and the BJP will be confined to less than 15 in the south.\nSpeaking at public meetings in support of the Congress-led UDF in Kerala, Revanth Reddy said the southern states, including Telangana, will play a key role in dethroning the BJP-led government at the Centre and paving the way for the formation of the Congress-led INDIA government and Rahul Gandhi will take oath as the Prime Minister on June 9.\nDuring his interaction with farmers in Kerala, the Chief Minister recalled that the BJP-led government at the Centre failed to deliver on its major poll promise of doubling farmers' income in the last 10 years.\nHe accused Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of colluding with Prime Minister Narendra Modi fearing ED cases against him and supporting the BJP candidate in Wayanad Lok Sabha seat against Rahul Gandhi.\nThe TPCC chief said that as the BJP is losing ground in northern states, it is trying to win more seats from southern states, but it also proved futile.\n\"In southern states, there are 130 seats. The BJP is going to get hardly 12-15. The rest will go with INDIA.

The BJP is also trying to confuse people with the '400 paar' campaign but the voters will teach the BJP a lesson.\"\nRevanth Reddy said the people of Kerala have a golden opportunity at hand to have their own MP (Rahul Gandhi) as the next prime minister. He accused Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan of failing to take on Narendra Modi effectively because of his alleged corruption.\n“The Kerala Chief Minister’s role model is KCR.

    "content": " NEW DELHI: In another few hours, the curtain will finally lift from the Lok Sabha battleground for 2024.\n\n One hundred and two Lok Sabha seats across 21 states and Union territories will go to the polls in the first phase Friday. During the last general election, the Opposition had won 45 of these 102 Lok Sabha seats, while the BJP-led NDA had won 41. With 39 seats in Tamil Nadu and one in Puducherry, the largest number of seats which will vote in the first phase is from South India. In 2019, the DMK-led alliance won 39 of the 40 seats in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. \n\n\n Armed with the potent arsenal of Lord Ram, Sanatan Dharma, the Citizenship Amendment Act and the unyielding promise of “Modi’s guarantees”, the BJP aims to unsettle its main rival, the I.N.D.I.A. bloc. With rising unemployment, inflation, communal tension, caste census and the farmers’ agitation emerging as the frontline battlegrounds, the I.N.D.I.A. bloc is all set to engage its adversaries head-on.\n\n\n There are a few wrinkles on the saffron forehead as the 2024 CSDS-Lokniti pre-poll survey indicated that “unemployment and price rise” remained the main concern of the electorate. As the BJP sought to emphasise issues like the inauguration of the Ram temple and went into a high decibel campaign on Sanatan Dharma, these issues failed to click with voters “in comparison to livelihood concerns”. Regardless, the survey indicated that the BJP and its allies have a “comfortable 12 per cent lead over the I.N.D.I.A. bloc”.\n\n\n Meanwhile, all eyes are on Tamil Nadu where the BJP is desperate to open its account. Besides the charisma and popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP is also banking heavily on its newfound Tamil star and state unit chief, former IPS officer K. Annamalai, his constituency Coimbatore will be going to the polls on Friday.\n\n\n His seven-month long “\n En Mann, En Makkal” (My land, my people) padayatra culminated in a rally attended by the Prime Minister. In Coimbatore, Annamalai is locked in a triangular fight with the DMK and AIADMK. In Tamil Nadu, the BJP led by Modi had been repeatedly hitting out at the DMK leaders for “insulting” Sanatan Dharma.\n\n\n Under Annamalai in Tamil Nadu, the BJP is contesting 23 seats on its own, a departure from its approach to contest as an ally.\n\n\n Speaking to this newspaper, a senior BJP leader sounded somewhat cynical. He argued: “The BJP has no traditional vote bank in Tamil Nadu. We only gained when the party aligned with the Dravidian players.” It was further argued that Tamil Nadu might not “positively respond” to the BJP’s call for “one language, one nation, one poll”.\n\n\n Tamil Nadu’s electoral dynamics are crucial for the BJP's broader electoral objectives, whether it aims to retain its current seats or make significant gains towards achieving a landmark majority in the Lok Sabha.\n\n\n Of its 80 Lok Sabha seats, the first phase of polling will be held in eight seats in Uttar Pradesh. The state — which has often been electorally viewed as the “gateway to Delhi”, will be involved in all seven phases of the general election. It may be recalled that of the eight seats voting on Friday, the BJP had managed to win only three in the last general election. These were Pilibhit, Kairana and Muzaffarnagar. The Samajwadi Party had won Moradabad and Rampur. The Bahujan Samaj Party won Saharanpur, Bijor and Nagina.\n\n\n Of the 25 Lok Sabha seats in Rajasthan, polling in the first phase will be held in 12 seats. Securing 24 of 25 seats, it was a clean sweep for the BJP in the desert state during the last general election. Even as the BJP is banking on religion and the CAA to woo the voters, the Opposition is stoking the fire of farmers’ protests, which it believes is simmering in the desert state.\n\n\n Of 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra, polling will be held in five seats on Friday. In the fray will be Union minister Nitin Gadkari' on his home turf Nagpur. Given the context of the intense political manipulation in the state, the situation may become tricky for the BJP. During the last general election, it had won 23 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats. Its ally, the Shiv Sena (before the split), secured 18 seats. Sources revealed that in the case of the Uddhav Thackery-led Shiv Sena, the fallout with the BJP and subsequent political maneuvering to oust it, “could potentially elicit sympathy” from certain sections of voters. Unemployment has also emerged as a major electoral issue\" in the state, a Congress leader claimed. \n\n\n Other states and union territories going to polls in the first phase include: Madhya Pradesh (6) Bihar (4), Assam (5),Uttarakhand (5), West Bengal (3), Chhattisgarh (1), Arunachal Pradesh (2), Manipur (2), Meghalaya (2), Mizoram (1), Nagaland (1), Sikkim (1), Tripura (1), Andaman and Nicobar Islands (1), Jammu and Kashmir (1), Lakshadweep (1) and Puducherry (1).\n \n \n  \n  \n \n\n",

    "content": " Vijayawada: In a major breakthrough, the Vijayawada police on Thursday arrested a 19-year-old in relation to Saturday’s stone attack on Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, which left him injured on the forehead.\nThe accused was Vemula Satish Kumar alias Satti, a resident of Vaddera Colony in Ajith Singh Nagar. The Principal Junior Civil Judge’s Court remanded him to 14 days’ custody after the police produced him in court in the afternoon.\nNotably, names of several Telugu Desam-linked persons, including its Vijayawada Central Assembly seat aspirant Bonda Umamaheshwara Rao, had been in circulation in recent days about their suspected involvement in the attack. The police did not mention Umamaheshwara Rao or others in the remand report.\nOn Thursday, arguments were made in the court on behalf of both sides. Abdul Salim, counsel for Satish, argued that he was a minor and had no criminal record. How could the police file a case of attempted murder for an act of ‘throwing a stone’.\nIt was brought to the attention of the court that Section 307 was not applicable in this case.\nCounsel said the date of birth details given by the police and the date on Satish’s Aadhaar did not match. The date of birth in the Aadhaar card should be taken into account, he stressed.\nA lawyer, on behalf of the police, argued that the CM was attacked with a stone. This was done with malicious intent. ‘Attempt to murder’ section was applicable, he said.\nAfter hearing the arguments, the court said it would consider the certificate given by the municipal authorities regarding the date of birth. The accused was ordered to be remanded till May 2.\nThe stone was thrown at the Chief Minister during the 'Memantha Siddham' election campaign at Vivekananda School in Ajith Singh Nagar on the evening of April 13.\nSatish was identified as Accused 1 (A-1), while another individual, Vemula Durga Rao, was named A-2. “Satish threw the stone at Jagan Reddy under the instigation of Durga Rao, a political party activist,” the remand report said without explicitly naming the TD.\nThe report stated that Satish, under Durga Rao’s guidance, had intentionally hurled the stone at Jagan Mohan Reddy with the intent to harm or kill him.\nThe police said the investigation in the case was incomplete and they were yet to examine some more witnesses, to analyse technical evidence apart from collection of some more evidence. \nThe remand report stated that Al (Satish) was convinced by the proposal of his instigator and agreed to do the same. “He implemented the plan on April 13, at 08.04 pm, by standing beside a group of people at the Vivekananda School, AS Nagar, in Vijayawada.”\n“He picked up a sharp-edged cement concrete stone from his pocket and strongly threw it at the temporal part of the head of Jagan Reddy with an intention to cause a deadly shot against him, so as to do away with the CM’s life, as per the prior agreement/conspiracy (sic).”\nThe police said, “Luckily the CM survived the attack. The sharp-edged cement concrete stone missed hitting the sensitive temporal part of the CM’s head, and it touched a spot above the left eye of the CM.”\n\"After examining all the evidence and recording the statements of 12 witnesses, we filed an ‘attempted murder’ case against Satish,\" the police report added.",

Kiran's brother, Kishore Kumar Reddy, contests from the Piler assembly constituency on a Telugu Desam ticket, intensifying the battle between the two dynasties.\nRemarks political analyst Dr Ramana Murthy, “The outcome of this epic battle will reshape the power dynamics in the region.”\nWhile the Nallari brothers accuse the Peddireddys of unchecked regional dominance, corruption, and high-handedness, the rival camp, fuelled by a sense of retribution and a desire to settle issues that arose during Kiran Reddy's tenure as CM, is fighting back with full force.\n\"Peddireddy, openly branding the Nallari siblings as the family’s primary political adversaries, has thrown his full weight behind his son’s candidacy, framing the election as a decisive moment to defeat his archenemy Kiran. However, the Nallaris have united the TD, JS, and BJP cadres in Rajampet to boost their electoral prospects. This gripping clash is expected to reshuffle the region's power dynamics for years to come,\" feels Murthy.\nAfter the demise of former CM, YS Rajasekhara Reddy in 2009, the Peddireddy clan shifted their loyalties to the YSRC and backed his son YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, while Kiran Reddy became chief minister and remained with the Congress until recently. After a hiatus, Kiran joined the BJP, setting the stage for this high-stakes battle.",

The Lok Sabha election is a contest not against a dancer or ‘Babli’ (a con character in a Hindi film) but a fight between Maharashtra and Modi,” Raut said.\nThe Sena UBT Rajya Sabha MP made the controversial comments while addressing a campaign rally in Amaravati in support of Congress candidate Balwant Wankhede, who is pitted against Rana in the Lok Sabha polls. The Uddhav Thackeray-led party is an ally of the Congress.\nRaut asked the Sena UBT workers to ensure the defeat of Rana in Amravati. “It is the primary and moral responsibility of every Shivsainik to defeat a woman, who tried to challenge the Matoshree (residence of Uddhav Thackeray in Mumbai) and used foul language for Hindu religion. She had tried to enter Matoshree by force (during a Hanuman Chalisa agitation in 2022),” he added.\nRana, an actor-turned-politician, was elected from Amravati as an independent in 2019 and she is now contesting from the same constituency on a BJP ticket.\nLegislator Manisha Kayande from the Eknath Shinde-led Sena slammed Raut for his comments and urged the Election Commission to ban him from taking further part in the election campaign, on the lines of Congress leader Randeep Surjewala, who had used alleged insulting words against BJP MP Hema Malini.\nSaying that Raut’s comments have exposed his hatred towards women, she demanded that the EC should ban Raut from addressing rallies during the campaign and he should not be allowed to give any speeches or interviews to media during the entire campaign period.\nTwo days ago, the EC barred Surjewala from campaigning for 48 hours over his alleged derogatory remarks against Hema Malini.",

Union minister Narayan Rane will file his nomination on Friday for the seat, which Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena also wanted. However, the alliance is yet to resolve issues over five more seats including Mumbai South, Mumbai North West, Thane, Palghar and Nasik seats.\nAccording to an insider of Mahayuti, BJP leadership, specially deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, convinced the Shiv Sena that Narayan Rane would be the right candidate for the Ratnagiri–Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency,. The BJP also pacified Kiran Samant, who is brother of Maharashtra Cabinet Minister Uday Samant, to leave his claim over the seat.\nThere will be a direct fight between Shiv Sena (UBT) candidate Vinayak Raut and Mr. Rane in Ratnagiri- Sindhudurg.

Thane is also the home turf of Mr. Shinde.\n\"We are ready to leave the Palghar seat for Shiv Sena, but we will not leave our claim over the Thane seat as it is with the Thackeray faction.

    "content": " According to reports, in Pune, 16 EVMs had to be replaced (Photo: DC Archive)According to reports, in Pune, 16 EVMs had to be replaced (Photo: DC Archive)NEW DELHI: Stressing the need to maintain and protect voters' trust, the Supreme Court on Thursday cautioned the petitioners against doubting the electronic voting machines (EVMs). While reserving its verdict on a batch of pleas seeking complete cross-verification of votes cast using EVMs with voter verifiable paper audit trail slips (VVPAT) a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta said the integrity of the entire electoral process must be ensured as over suspicion of everything is a problem. \n\n The top court underscored the importance of voter satisfaction and trust in the electoral system and told petitioners, who sought its direction to go back to using ballot papers, not to suspect the efficacy of the EVMs.\n The remarks by the bench came when advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing petitioner NGO Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), sought reversal of the poll panel's 2017 decision to replace the transparent glass on VVPAT machines with an opaque glass through which a voter can see the slip only when the light is on for seven seconds.\n \"I understand it is election eve. At least the bulb that glows for seven seconds should be allowed to glow continuously after the button is pressed in the EVM,\" Mr Bhushan said.\n The bench told Mr Bhushan that voter satisfaction and trust are at the core of the electoral process. \"Mr Bhushan, now you are going too far. This is too much. Whether it's transparent or translucent glass on a VVPAT machine or the glowing of a bulb, ultimately it is the voter's satisfaction and trust (that matters). The bulb only helps you see better, that's all.\"\n The top court said, \"Everything cannot be suspected. You (Mr Bhushan) cannot be critical of everything. If they (the Election Commission) have done something good, you have to appreciate it. You don't have to be critical of everything.\"\n Replying to the bench, Mr Bhushan said he is not casting any aspersion on the poll panel, but the possibility for improvement exists. \n Justice Khanna told him: \"Agree. But if they have improved things within the four corners of the law, then it is fine. Bulb or no bulb, how does it matter? If an explanation is given, then you must appreciate it. Over suspicion of everything is a problem. A voter has to satisfy himself, that's all. They gave an explanation for the improvement, you heard them and everyone heard them.\"\n Solicitor-general Tushar Mehta said that as an officer of the court, he is submitting that these efforts by petitioners to doubt the efficacy of EVMs on the eve of the elections have an impact on voter percentage. \n Mr Mehta said: \"By these efforts, the vote percentage gets affected. People may think that something is wrong. The democratic choice of voter is being made into a joke despite repeated rebukes to them (the petitioners) by this court. I have asked my side to be ready for planted news reports and articles. Every time there is an important hearing, planted news reports and articles come up.\"\n The bench asked Mr Mehta to leave it at that and clarified that the ADR petition was filed last year and that it was the court's fault that the matter could not be heard. \"Yes, some new petitions have come now, but the one in which Mr Bhushan is appearing was filed long back. We have learnt to deal with comments on social media and people have the freedom to post their opinions on social media,\" Justice Khanna told Mr Mehta.\n During the nearly daylong hearing, the bench also interacted for nearly an hour with senior deputy election commissioner Nitesh Kumar Vyas to understand the functioning of EVMs.\n The bench posed several questions to Mr Vyas and said, \"There seems to be some gap between what is available in the public domain and what should be available in the public domain. That needs to be bridged.\"\n During the hearing on Thursday, the poll panel informed the top court that allegations of EVMs showing one extra vote during a mock poll in Kasaragod (Kerala) were false.\n \"These news reports are false. We have verified the allegation from the district collector and it appears that they are false. We will submit a detailed report to the court,\" Mr Vyas told the bench while countering the charge of Mr Bhushan.\n On petitioners’ plea that paper ballots should be used instead of EVMs, the bench said, \"Paper ballots have huge drawbacks and we don't want to think about them. Instead, we were thinking of using barcodes for political parties in the future, but that will be a humongous task.\"\n \"The Indian system is working well and the voting percentage is increasing in every election, which shows people are having faith in the system. We all know what used to happen with ballot papers,\" the bench said, referring to rigging and booth capturing incidents during elections in the past.\n The bench said this while responding to the petitioners' contention that several developed countries have gone back to using ballot papers in elections.\n Senior advocate Maninder Singh, representing the poll panel, said EVMs are standalone machines and cannot be tampered with, but the possibility of human error cannot be ruled out.\n Underscoring that the electoral process has to have sanctity, Justice Datta told Mr Singh, \"You have to allay the apprehensions, both in the court and outside the court. Let nobody have the apprehension that something that is expected is not being done.\"\n The poll panel told the bench that no mismatch has ever been detected between the votes counted in the EVMs and VVPAT slips.\n The Election Commission submitted that it has matched the EVM votes with more than 4 crores VVPAT slips and no instance of mismatch has been found so far.\n The poll panel made the submission in the written statement filed in response to the queries raised by the top court during the hearing on Tuesday in connection with the petitions seeking complete verification of the EVM data with VVPAT.\n In a 14-page affidavit, the poll panel assured the top court that it is impossible to tamper with EVMs “at any stage”.\n On a query from the bench if tampering of EVMs was possible after polling, the Election Commission said polling officers press the “close” button at the end of polling and the machines do not accept any votes. The presiding officer records the poll start and close timings in the machine.\n After the close of polling, the control unit is switched off and the ballot unit is disconnected from the control unit. It is then kept separately in their carrying cases and sealed with paper slips on which the polling agents sign, the poll panel said in its affidavit.\n On a query from the bench about whether it is possible for a voter to get a slip after voting, the Election Commission flagged concerns that this will compromise the secrecy of the vote and may be misused outside the booth. \"How it can be used by others, we cannot say,\" the poll panel said.\n Mr Bhushan and senior advocate Gopal Sankararanarayanan appeared for the petitioners. Other lawyers represented the intervenors. \n On Tuesday, the top court had questioned arguments questioning the sanctity of voting through EVMs based on data from private agencies and cautioned the petitioners against seeking to “bring down the system”.\n Taking a dim view of calls for reverting to ballot papers, the apex court said the electoral process in India is a \"humongous task\" and recalled how polling booths were captured in the era of ballot papers to manipulate election results.\n The seven-phase Lok Sabha polls begin on April 19.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n    \n     \n      \n       \n        \n        \n         \n          \n         \n       \n      \n     \n    \n   \n  \n \n\n",

But they are not very familiar with Kondapalli Srinivasa Rao.  \n Meanwhile, minister Botcha Satynarayan's brother, Botcha Appalanarasayya, is a well-known face in the constituency. \n In the 2019 polls, the YSRC’s Pamula Pushpa Sreevani won Kurupam with 74,527 votes, humbling her closest rival Janardhan Thatraj Veeravaratodramala of TD, who received 47,925 votes. This was her successful re-election as MLA there.  \n In June 2019, she was made one of the five deputy chief ministers, and entrusted with the role of tribal welfare. Sreevani's popularity increased when her TikTok video featuring YS Jagan Reddy went viral.  \n She is representing YSRC for the third time and is being challenged by TD candidate Toka Jagadheswari. Jagadheswari is supported by Satrucharla Vijayaramaraju, Pushpa Sreevani’s father-in-law.  \n While this is a strong point for the TD nominee, her personal identity does not have much impact on Kurupam voters. \n In the 2019 elections, Alajangi Jogarao of the YSRC won the Parvathipuram SC reserved seat. He secured 75,304 votes, winning by a margin of 24,199 votes against his opponent, Bobbili Chiranjeevulu. Jogarao's victory was a significant contribution to the YSRC’s landslide win at that time.  \n Currently, Bonela Vijaya Chandra from the TD is contesting against Alajangi Jogarao. Vijaya Chandara, originally from Parvathipuram, had moved to Visakhapatnam for business purposes. However, after the pandemic, he became active in Parvathipuram politics. Vijaya Chandra is financially well-off, but he is not a well-known face in the Parvathipuram constituency.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n",

    "content": " ADILABAD: Every citizen has only one vote in India. People in 12 villages on the border of Telangana state and Maharashtra, however, are special as they have had votes in both states for the last 30 years. \n \n For the Telangana state government, these villages are part of the Kerameri mandal of Komaram Bheem district, while Maharashtra considers them to be the residents of Jivati taluk of Chandrapur district. They are part of the Asifabad Assembly constituency of Telangana state and the Rajura Assembly constituency of Maharashtra. \n While a case is pending in the Supreme Court between the two state governments, people have been playing voting in both states in all elections at all levels. Many voters in these villages have been getting an old-age pension of `1,500 from Maharashtra and `2,000 from the Telangana state government for a long time. \n They have Aadhaar cards with the same number issued from Maharashtra and Telangana state in addition to having voter identity cards and ration cards issued by the two states. \n The 12 villages have 5,117 voters — 2,694 male and 2423 female — and they have decided to vote in the polling for the Chandrapur Lok Sabha seat in Maharashtra on April 19 and also for the Adilabad Lok Sabha seat in Telangana on May 13.  \n From Chandrapur Lok Sabha constituency, Prathibha Dhanorkar is contesting as a Congress candidate, Sudhir Mungantiwar as a BJP candidate and Rajesh Bhele of the Vanchith Bahujan Aghadi.  \n Ramdas Ranveer of Mukhaddamguda in Kerameri mandal said, “It was the mistake of the Election Commission of India (ECI) and state governments which issued two voter cards and ration cards. One can’t fault the villagers.” \n \"If two states compete to offer welfare schemes, who will refuse them,” asked Ramdas Ranveer, who said many families had migrated to these disputed villages in search of agricultural land in 1962 from Maratwada of Maharashtra. \n “Political parties in both states want our votes. That is why they offer us welfare schemes without restrictions,” he said. \n Kamble Laxman, sarpanch of Parandholi, said revenue officials from the Keramari tahsildar office visited their villages and asked them not to cast their vote in the Maharashtra elections. \n He made it clear that the voters of 12 disputed bordering villages would cast their vote in the election of both Telangana and Maharashtra till the Supreme Court pronounced its judgment.  \n",

    "content": " Hyderabad: Justice B Vijaysen Reddy of the Telangana High Court ordered notices to the Chaderghat station house officer and others for allegedly closing a complaint without assigning any reason. The judge was dealing with a writ plea filed by Koppula Manjula who said she had lodged a complaint against the Yashoda Hospitals and its doctors for alleged improper treatment to her husband’s thyroid condition. The petitioner alleged that doctors at the hospital were negligent and did not follow due diligence and treated her husband for epilepsy instead of thyroid disease due to which he died. The petitioner said that on March 14, a complaint was registered with the Chaderghat police and on March 27 she received a SMS from stating that the complaint was closed as “action abated”. Counsel Baglekar Akash, appearing for the petitioner, argued that such closure remarks, without assigning any detailed reason, was illegal and arbitrary. The petitioner had also prayed for a general direction to all the station house officers and investigation officers to provide detailed reasons in case of closure of the complaints without registering the First Information Report (FIR) in the police website. The judge accordingly ordered notices and posted the matter to May 3.\n \n HC calls for PCB closure records \n A two-judge panel of the Telangana High Court on Thursday ordered notices to the authorities for alleged inaction in closing an illegal stone-crushing unit at Bandiravirala, Abdullapurmet. The panel comprising Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice J. Anil Kumar was dealing with a writ plea filed by Ramidi Bal Reddy. The petitioner said that the authorities had failed to prevent GMR Stone Crushers, Vasavi Stone Crushers and other units which were operating without permission. The petitioner said he owned an adjacent portion of land and had submitted a representation to the authorities but failed to get a response. Per contra, standing counsel for the TS Pollution Control Board (TSPCB), on instructions, submitted that suitable action on the representation submitted by the petitioner was taken and a direction was issued to the industries on February 6 not to operate the stone crusher units. The panel after perusing the material ordered notices and granted two weeks to the TSPCB to place on record the copy of the order issued on February 6. \n Ameerpet road project under scanner \n Justice T. Vinod Kumar of Telangana High Court grilled the GHMC qua the road development plan from Ameerpet Bata showroom to Yousufguda. The judge asked the authorities if they had issued notices calling for objections regarding the road widening. The judge made the observation while hearing a writ petition filed by Sri Gangadhara Bhakta Samajam. The petitioner complained that the GHMC had not considered their representations made on February 15, and proceeded further with the road development. He contended that the action was arbitrary and against the principles of natural justice. GHMC standing counsel sought time to get instructions. The judge posted the matter to April 25.  \n Transfer of CISF cop set aside A two-judge panel of the Telangana High Court set aside an order of a single judge who had interfered with a transfer of a CISF constable to Ranchi. The panel comprising Justice Sujoy Paul and Justice N. Tukaramji was dealing with a writ appeal filed by the Union of India and others challenging the order directing the authorities to consider the case of CISF constable and post him in and around the Hyderabad unit. It was the case of the writ petitioner that the Mental Health Care Act, 2107 specified rights for persons with mental illness and as per which the appropriate government should provide treatment in a manner which supports persons with mental illness to live in the community and with their families and also to ensure that no person with mental illness shall be required to travel long distances to access mental health services and as such services shall be available close to place where a person with mental illness resides. The single judge had examined the medical board records which stated that the petitioner was under low medical category duty without firearms, and that he was married and had two children and that his wife left him because of his behavioural problems. The history of mental illness in his family was not known and he lived in a joint family along with his parents and his family. The single judge accordingly directed the respondents to reconsider the case of the petitioner and to post him in and around the CISF, Hyderabad unit, as he is native of Karimnagar district. The panel found that the order of transfer was based on the factum that the constable was suffering from bipolar affective disorder with psychosis and that the transfer was based after considering the fact that the medical centre in Ranchi had the facility to address such an ailment. \n\n",

I can say this is a challenge.”\nShe wondered, “BJP triggered an incident there the day before yesterday. Its MLA led an attack with his followers at the same place.

But he fell at the feet of RSS and joined BJP to save his son. I didn't know that he was such a big traitor.”",

Rajesh Chandra, DCP of Yadadri district.\n“We tried out the decades-old tradition of `dandora` to communicate with the locals. We got a very good response from the villagers who were terrified by the incidents,” he said.\nPolice noticed that the gangs struck only at night. “Initially, we conducted checks across the district, and agriculture areas isolated villages only during nights,” he said.\nOn April 16 night, the DCP directed the local police officer to organise awareness campaigns at night, beating the dandora to draw the attention of the locals. “Dongalu vastunnaru, byata padukovadam kudaradu, intlo oadukovali (Beware! Robbers are on the prowl. Don’t sleep outside the home, sleep only in the house),” the police teams announced.\nDuring the day, several autorickshaws equipped with loudspeakers were deployed to relay the message.\nHowever, the DCP posted police personnel dressed in civil dress in each group and intensified patrolling in the identified villages. The officers were directed to be alert 24/7 till the gang is arrested and the situation in the villages retains normalcy.\nThanks to the awareness programme, police said the villages have not reported even a single incident of chain-snatching from April 7 till April 18. “A special thanks to the police who are working 24/7 for ordinary people like us,” G. Mangamma, an elderly woman from Dilaverpally village, Yadadri district, said.",

Raghavendra on Thursday filed his nominations to contest the ensuing Shivamogga Lok Sabha election where he is facing rebellion from his senior party man and former Deputy Chief Minister K.S. Eshwarappa who has also entered the fray as an independent nominee. The Congress party has fielded Geeta Shivarajkumar, daughter of late Chief Minister S. Bangarappa.\nShivamogga Lok Sabha seat has been a stronghold of the BJP and its nominees won in 1998 when Ayanur Manjunath was the nominee, later former Chief Minister S. Bangarappa won the seat as BJP nominee in 2004. In 2005, Bangarappa switched sides and won the Shivamogga seat as a Samajwadi Party nominee.\nHowever, the BJP made a comeback in the Shivamogga Lok Sabha seat when B.Y. Raghavendra, son of former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, won against S. Bangarappa in the 2009 Shivamogga Lok Sabha election. In 2014, B.S. Yediyurappa won the Shivamogga seat and in the 2018 bye-election, his son Raghavendra won the seat and also retained the seat in the 2019 election.\nBut, in the ensuing election, Raghavendra is hit by rebellion from his senior party leader K.S. Eshwarappa who is an independent nominee in Shivamogga seat. Eshwarappa had lashed at Yediyurappa and accused him of conducting ‘dynastic’ politics in Shivamogga. since his son has been re-nominated for Shivamogga seat while his other son B.Y. Vijayendra is the State BJP Chief and also an MLA representing Shikaripura seat.\nEshwarappa was annoyed after his son Kantesh was denied a BJP ticket to contest from Haveri Lok Sabha seat and a disgruntled Eshwarappa announced to fight the Shivamogga seat against BJP nominee Raghavendra and exuded confidence that Raghavendra would be defeated in the poll.\nFor Congress nominee Geeta Shivarajkumar, wife of cine actor Shivarajkumar, it is her second try in Shivamogga Lok Sabha seat. Her first contest as JDS nominee in 2014 was unsuccessful and she had to face former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in the poll fray and finished third in the contest.\nIn the 2018 Shivamogga Lok Sabha seat, Geeta’s brother Madhu Bangarappa, now Minister for Primary and Secondary Education has fought the parliamentary election from Shivamogga and ended up losing against BJP nominee B.Y. Raghavendra of BJP. Again, he lost to Raghavendra in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. \nThe nominees are engaged in brisk campaigning in the seat and Shivamogga gopes for voting on May 7.",

    "content": " Chennai:�All the 39 constituencies of the State, along with the lone seat in neighbouring Puducherry, are going to polls on Friday in the first phase of the nation-wide Lok Sabha elections that for the first time saw the ruling DMK in the State, particularly Chief Minister M K Stalin, spearheading a campaign to bring about a change at the national level, thus lending an acrimonious hue to it in its last stages.\nIn a break from the electoral traditions of the State, the BJP headed a third front to fight the usual alliances headed by the DMK and AIADMK, turning the three week campaign into an acerbic exchange of words, ideas and ideologies and displaying an unusual desperation to find a toe hold in the State, where it had won seats in the past only by riding piggyback on either of the Dravidian majors other than in 2014 when Pon Radhakrishnan romped home in Kanyakumari.\nThe BJP’s highly charged campaign brought the top brass of the party - Prime Minister Narendra Modi alone made nine visits to campaign for candidates of its alliance and launched a strident attack on the DMK and its leaders, both past and present – to the State. Modi also made a bid to appropriate the legacy of AIADMK icons M G Ramchandran and J Jayalalithaa by showering praises on their memory.\nWhile the DMK managed to retain almost all its allies of the coalition that won 38 of the 39 seats in 2019 and also became a part of the national opposition coalition, INDIA, and ensured that its campaigners reached every nook and cranny of the State with Stalin himself visiting all the constituencies apart from his son and State Minister Udhayanidhi Stalin, the main rival AIADMK was struggling to find allies.\nThe AIADMK that broke its ties with the BJP in September, 2023, finally could get only the DMDK, founded by the late Vijayakanth, as a major ally, though its general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami went on a whirlwind tour of the State as perhaps the lone star campaigner of the party.\nThe Naam Tamizhar Katchi (NTK), the only major party to field candidates in all the constituencies – 50 per cent of them women – also made its presence felt on the campaign scene, with its chief coordinator Seeman addressing meetings all over the State in support of his candidates. The NTK overcame an initial setback that came in the form of his old symbol being allotted to some other party. Then it was give the ‘microphone’ symbol, over which too there were minor issues.\nOtherwise, 950 candidates are in the fray and the over 6.23 crore voters would exercise their franchise at nearly 68,000 polling stations from 7 am on Friday though the counting of votes would happen only on June 4 after all the seven phases of polling were completed.\nAmong the constituencies that gained some significance in the run up to the polls were Coimbatore, from where BJP State President is contesting. It also came into limelight following Rahul Gandhi’ visit to the constituency that saw him jump over a median to buy sweets for his ‘brother Stalin’ from a shop.\nWith the DMK’s IT wing publicizing the video that went viral, Rahul Gandhi’s singular visit to the State earned more prominence than all the campaigns undertaken by a slew of national leaders of the BJP, Modi, Amit Shah, J P Nadda, Rajnath Singh and Nirmala Sitharaman.\nThe campaign in general saw the raking up of ceding of Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka in 1974, parties like BJP, AIADMK, PMK and NTK taking about a rise in drug usage in the State with a vow to eliminate it if they were voted in. The PMK is focusing on Dharmapuri, where Sowmiya Anbumani is in the fray, while the DMK, AIADMK and Congress have fielded many old hands\nDMK's Dayanidhi Maran (Central Chennai), A Raja (Nilgiris), Kanimozhi (Thoothukudi), BJP's L Murugan (Nilgiris), Tamilisai Soundararajan (South Chennai), former Chief Minister O Panneerselvam (Ramanathapuram), Congress party's Karti Chidambaram (Sivaganga) and AIADMK's J Jayavardhan (South Chennai) and AMMK chief TTV Dhinakaran are among the popular faces in the fray.\nWhile the crux of BJP’s campaign was aimed at unseating the DMK by accusing it of corruption and practicing dynasty, the DMK had said that the election was about not who should win but about who should not by pointing to the alleged corruption and failures of the BJP government in the past 10 years. Stalin had also been repeatedly highlighting the BJP’s neglect of Tamil Nadu and winning over the State’s rights.",

    "content": " NEW DELHI: Hours after the Enforcement Directorate told a Delhi court that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been deliberately eating mangoes and other foods to raise his blood sugar level and create grounds for bail on medical grounds, city minister Atishi on Thursday alleged there is a “huge conspiracy” to kill him by denying him home-cooked food in Tihar jail.\nMs Atishi accused the ED of lying about the chief minister's diet. “The BJP, through its wing ED, is trying to harm Mr Kejriwal's health. They are trying to stop the supply of home-cooked food to him in jail. The ED lied in court and said that Mr Kejriwal has been consuming tea with sugar and eating sweets. This is a complete lie. Mr Kejriwal has been taking an artificial sweetener,” she said.\nThe minister said that once Mr Kejriwal is disallowed home food, “it will not be known what he is being fed in jail and when”. She alleged: “From the past few days, Mr Kejriwal’s sugar level has been over 300 mg/dl, but he has been denied insulin by Tihar jail authorities. There's a conspiracy to kill Mr Kejriwal by stopping his home-cooked food supply.” \n\n Earlier in the day, the ED made the “deliberate attempt to spike up the sugar level” claim before special judge Kaveri Baweja, who directed the Tihar jail authorities to file a report in the matter, including Mr Kejriwal’s diet chart.\n Mr Kejriwal, who is in judicial custody for his role in the alleged excise policy case, had moved the court to seek permission to consult his regular doctor via video conference because of his fluctuating sugar levels. The judge directed the authorities concerned to file the report by Friday, when the court is likely to take up the matter again.\n After the hearing, ED counsel Zoheb Hossain told the media that Mr Kejriwal has withdrawn his application after the probe agency submitted that he is trying to create a situation wherein he could be moved to a hospital or move a bail plea on medical grounds.\n Mr Hossain told the special judge that Mr Kejriwal has been eating high-sugar-content food despite having type 2 diabetes. He said: “Mr Kejriwal has been intentionally consuming aloo pooris, mangoes and sweets daily. This is being done to make grounds for his bail on medical grounds… The person is in the court's custody...and the court has to ensure the person is not posing a health hazard, even to himself.”\n The ED made these submissions in the Rouse Avenue court after reportedly obtaining a list of foods that the Delhi chief minister had been eating over the past 15 days as well as a list detailing his blood sugar levels.\n According to the jail report: \"The high glycaemic index diet taken on a regular basis for breakfast by Mr Kejriwal since April 2 included four eggs, two bananas and sweetened tea, apart from namkeen. He had also been eating rice, potatoes, tea and fruits, including mangoes, for lunch and bananas, sweets, rice, aloo subzi and namkeen for dinner. This, in turn, had increased his blood sugar from 116 in the morning on April 4 to 260 on April 12 and 276 on April 14.\" \n Mr Kejriwal’s legal team, however, insisted that all food items on the chief minister's diet chart had been prescribed by his doctor. His lawyer Vivek Jain accused the ED of cooking up excuses to stop the supply of home-cooked food, which was permitted by the court in view of the AAP chief's diabetes.\n “He has only been eating what is prescribed by doctors. This is an issue made up by the ED to stop home-cooked food for Mr Kejriwal. This concerns the health of the chief minister... Is the ED above the doctor?” asked Mr Jain while stating that the probe agency is just making statements for the sake of media publicity.\n Addressing a press conference, Ms Atishi said the ED told the court that Mr Kejriwal has been eating bananas. “Any doctor will tell you that diabetes patients are asked to carry bananas or any toffee or chocolate because a drop in sugar level can be dangerous for life. The ED said he has been eating aloo-puri. The ED should be afraid of God for lying so much. He ate puri only on the first day of Navratra. All these lies are being spread by the BJP and the ED to stop the supply of home-cooked food for Mr Kejriwal,” she alleged.\n Mr Kejriwal’s judicial custody was extended till April 23 by a Delhi court on Monday in the money-laundering case related to the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy. He was first sent to Tihar Jail on April 1, hours after Ms Baweja sent him to judicial custody till April 15.\n On Thursday, the special judge sent Chanpreet Singh, who allegedly managed the AAP’s funds during the 2022 Goa Assembly elections, to judicial custody till April 23, after the expiry of his ED custody.\n The judge also extended till April 26 the judicial custody of AAP leader Manish Sisodia in the money laundering case linked to the alleged excise scam. The judge extended the former Delhi deputy CM's custody after he was produced before the court through a video conference.\n Mr Sisodia's co-accused and party colleague, Sanjay Singh, who was recently granted bail by the Supreme Court in the case, also appeared before the court through a video conference. \n\n",

I thank them for their support to the Congress in this significant battle to uphold democracy in our country,\" stated Uttam Kumar Reddy while addressing a gathering in Kodad.  \n   \n Uttam Kumar Reddy highlighted the significant message conveyed by the Left parties' decision, emphasising the unity of secular forces in the state against communal threats. He expressed concern over the erosion of democratic pillars during the tenure of the BJP-led government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, over the past decade. \n   \n The minister warned that the unchecked continuation of BJP rule in upcoming elections could result in the complete dismantling of the democratic framework. He attributed the BJP's electoral successes to the fragmentation among secular factions. \n   \n However, the formation of the I.N.D.I.A. bloc, spearheaded by the Congress and comprising 41 political entities, had neutralised BJP's tactic of exploiting divisions for political gain. \n   \n He predicted that the I.N.D.I.A. coalition is poised for victory and Rahul Gandhi would become Prime Minister. He forecast that the BJP-led NDA’s seat tally would not cross 200.  \n   \n Uttam Kumar Reddy emphasised that democracy was reinstated in the state following the establishment of the Congress government. He criticised the former BRS Government, led by K. Chandrashekar Rao, for collaborating with the Modi government to undermine democracy and erode constitutional principles. \n   \n He accused the BRS administration and the BJP of attempting to undermine the legislature through orchestrated defections, politicising the executive branch, and trying to influence the judiciary. He highlighted their manipulation of the media to suppress dissenting voices and promote their own agendas. \n   \n  Reddy praised the Congress party's decade-long struggle against the undemocratic, authoritarian BRS regime in the previous Assembly elections. He expressed confidence that, with the active support of the CPI and CPI (M), the Congress party would replicate its success in the Assembly elections, securing victory in 15 out of 17 Assembly seats.  \n   Referring to the Nalgonda Lok Sabha seat, he exuded confidence that Raghuveera Reddy would be elected. \n\n",

    "content": " As World Liver Day (April 19) draws near, doctors in the city emphasise the escalating concern of fatty liver disease and other liver conditions among all age groups, including children, and the negative impacts of modern dietary habits, particularly the high consumption of processed foods.\n\n  Dr Ankita P. Singh, chief of a prominent private diagnostic centre, shed light on the significant impact of diet and lifestyle on liver health, beyond the well-known effects of alcohol. She stressed the dangers of processed and packaged foods which are typically high in unhealthy fats, sugars, and additives.\n\n \n \"These foods contribute directly to liver strain through fostering conditions like fatty liver disease, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation,\" Dr Singh explained. Explaining the liver's critical role in overall health, Dr Dharmesh Kapoor, senior hepatologist and liver transplant specialist, “Liver diseases are significant yet largely preventable. The liver, a key player in our digestive system, processes everything we ingest, including food, drink, and medicine. It’s essential for fighting infections, regulating blood sugar, removing toxins, controlling cholesterol levels, and aiding digestion through bile production.” He noted that without proper care, the liver can be easily damaged, leading to advanced symptoms like appetite loss, weight loss, and jaundice, which are signs of significant liver damage.\n  To counteract these risks, Dr Sachin Daga, hepatobiliary pancreas and liver surgeon, recommended substantial lifestyle changes. “Avoid prolonged sitting; take short walks regularly. Include a robust amount of vegetables—400-500 grams daily—and proteins from legumes or lean meats in your diet,” he advises. Additionally, Dr Daga supported intermittent fasting to boost metabolism and liver function, suggesting, “Exercising during the peak of a 10-12 hour fasting window can significantly clear fat from the liver.” \n\n\n  Beyond dietary choices, Dr Singh highlighted other lesser-known factors that affect liver health. \"Many people are unaware that apart from poor dietary choices, factors such as certain medications, chronic viral infections like hepatitis B and C, and genetics can heavily influence liver health,\" she stated. She also spoke about the importance of regular screenings to maintain liver health. According to the doctor, liver function tests (LFTs), which measure enzyme and protein levels, alongside imaging tests such as ultrasounds or MRIs, are crucial. \"For those at higher risk, screenings for viral hepatitis and liver cancer are indispensable to detect issues before they develop into severe health problems,\" she added.\n\n\n  She urged the public to be vigilant for symptoms indicative of liver conditions such as persistent fatigue, abdominal pain or swelling, jaundice, unexplained weight loss, and dark urine. \"Recognising these symptoms early can be the key to effective management and treatment of liver diseases,\" she said. \n\n\n  Dr Kapoor also highlighted the importance of vaccination, “Protect yourself against hepatitis, which can be caused by viruses or harmful substances like alcohol. Vaccines are available for hepatitis A and B, which are vital in preventing the disease that often leads to jaundice, poor appetite, and malaise without noticeable symptoms.”\n\n",

The Congress leader sought to make a distinction between the BJP’s approach towards him and the CPM-led LDF chief minister.\nRahul said he disagreed with the BJP ideologically and what they are doing to the country. “I get up in the morning thinking how I am going to fight the BJP today.

But there is no such attack on the Kerala chief minister even though there are allegations of corruption here as well.\nRahul said when he came to Kerala or visited any other state, he always attacked the BJP-RSS. “But the Kerala CM is spending 24 hours attacking me. For some reason, he is not attacking the BJP. I leave it to you, think about it,” he said.\nYechury reacts to Rahul’s criticism\nCPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury who is campaigning extensively in Kerala, while reacting to Rahul Gandhi’s accusations, said the chief minister’s criticism need not be seen as a personal attack. “The criticism is against the policies of the Congress viz a viz the BJP government’s various actions. Congress has still not made its stand clear on the issue of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).\nChief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has chosen not to make any personal comments about Rahul Gandhi. Instead, he has criticized the Congress party's soft stance towards the policies of the BJP government. However, Rahul Gandhi appears to be trying to turn the criticism into a personal attack to connect with voters.\nIn every election meeting, the chief minister has questioned the stand taken by the Congress on issues like the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Similarly, he severely criticised the Congress MPs from Kerala for their failure to intervene effectively in Parliament on major issues like the abrogation of Article 370, and the Centre’s decisions to smother Kerala financially.\nPinarayi had also unleashed a scathing attack on the Congress leadership for failing to prevent the mass exodus of party leaders to the BJP.\nWith just a week left for the Lok Sabha polls in Kerala, both the Congress and the CPM have scaled up their attack on each other over the respective stand towards the BJP RSS\n\n",

    "content": " \n Tanishaa answers a volley of queries about her film, Mom Tanuja, sister Kajol, and Ajay Devgn’s film Maidaan which has not done well at the B.O and more-\n  Tanishaa Mukerji agreed to do a children's film titled,” Luv You Shankar\" directed by Rajiv S Ruia as not many children’s films are made nowadays. This film is a family film and the director has made successful children's films like My Friend Ganesha and knows how to make such films successful though making films is becoming a business model for the makers nowadays. The film is set to release on 19th April 2024. Starring Shreyas Talpade, Sanjay Mishra, and others.\n  \n Excerpts-\n  \n Significance of films releasing on festivals-\n In a way it's nice when a film is releasing on a festival day and our film, Luv You Shankar is a family film.Its a super hero film which revolves around an eight year old boy and Lord Shiva. You can take your children out and all the family members can enjoy an outing together. Films in our country are the finest mode of entertainment. Director Rajiv Ruia is known for making children films .Earlier he had made \"My name is Ganesha.\" Festivals are celebrations tour audiences likewise our film is also a celebration.\n Children films significant\n Nowadays film making has become a cut throat business...because makers don't understand the mantra of making films successful. This film maker has always made great children films so I would only say –It’s a family film which can be watched with your children\n On memories watching children film as a child-\n I had seen a Marathi film. I don't remember the name. A very strong role was played by an old-time Marathi actress. I remember she was a house wife and she was killed by her family. She then comes back in the form of a Devi Maa. How she comes back to life and teaches lessons to the family members forms the crux of the story. It was a religious film I remember as a kid- hum Ramayan aur Mahabharat watch karne ke liye wait karte the.\n On being spiritual-\n I'm not very religious but I am very spiritual . We shot this film in Banaras- Kashi. And visiting that religious place felt great. I have a lot of faith in Divinity. I believe in the creator.\n Her take on faith and friendship\n The film revisits the faith and friendship mantra. I feel friendship is a reflection of you. You can be as good a friend as you are. Every relationship is a reflection of who you are. Your relationship with your mother, sister, brother, and every one depends on you.\n Tanuja [mom] and your bond-\n Our mom-daughter relationship is fantastic. We are great friends. Together we have a lot of fun and enjoy each other’s company a lot. Together we often go out for lunch and dinner. We travel long and short distances, we live together, we fight, but we are very friendly and share a strong bond.\n We went traveling together but she went to Kolkata, America all by herself. We let her travel all alone. You have to be active, one shouldn’t become dependent on somebody cause then you will stop enjoying life.\n On Tanuja/Kajol/ Tanishaa working together\n My mother and both Kajol and myself have strong-headed personalities. There has to be a strong and gutsy director/ producer to take us together simply because each one of us will want what we want. You will see Tanuja on screen soon.\n  Lastly, in the Ajay Devgn starrer film,” Maidaan” she says this, “Yes, I have watched the n starrer film,” Maidaan” film. However, I am not a fan of football. I loved the film. It is an outstanding and phenomenal -real cinema based on this coach in sport-Football. Unfortunately, the audiences have not realized the enthralling storyline of Maidaan. Maybe, it was the wrong time to release it. There is no fault in the story. The film is brilliant. We all know this film cannot be stopped. With mouth publicity, the film should do well in the long run. However, the scenes canned on the football ground are heart-wrenching.\n\n",

    "content": " Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. (PTI File Image)Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. (PTI File Image) \n Bengaluru: Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Thursday observed that the situation would arise in coming days when former minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) nominee for Chikkaballapura parliamentary seat D. Sudhakar would be behind the bars over ‘corruption’ charges against him and exuded confidence that Sudhakar will be proved ‘corrupt’ (by the Court) over his alleged irregularities during Covid-19 pandemic. When Covid-19 hit, Sudhakar was the Minister for Health and Family Welfare Services under the BJP regime in the State. \n At a roadshow in Chikkaballapura town, Siddaramaiah stated investigation over the allegations of irregularities is underway and expressed confidence that the charges against the former minister would be proved and a situation would arise when he will be put behind bars.  \n At the roadshow with Congress nominee Raksha Ramaiah, Siddaramaiah said the verdict given by the people’s court is much bigger than the punishment awarded by judicial court and the verdict of the people’s court should be to defeat BJP-Janata Dal Secular consensus nominee D. Sudhakar.  \n “He should be defeated again,” said Siddaramaiah referring to the defeat of Sudhakar in the 2023 Assembly poll in Chikkaballapura Assembly seat. Now, Sudhakar has again entered the fray and managed to secure a BJP ticket using his influence and asked the voters “If (Sudhakar) is elected to Lok Sabha, corruption would increase.” “Do you wish for a corrupt person to be in the Lok Sabha?” he asked the gathering.  \n Siddaramaiah satted that a survey report has pointed out that BJP led National Democratic Alliance would win in about 200-220 seats in the ensuing Lok Sabha and a government led by Congress party and its allies would come to power at the Centre. \n Criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Chief Minister said Modi ruled the country for 10 years but failed to deliver his assurances made to the voters in 2014 and stated that the black money stashed in foreign countries would be brought to the country but that did not happen, youths had faith in Modi who had assured to generate 20 crore jobs but that also did not come true, farmers income to double also went futile among others. \n",

    "content": " \n\n In an exclusive conversation with Deccan Chronicle, renowned author Devdutt Pattanaik shares insights from his latest book, \"Sati, Savitri and other Feminist Tales They Don't Tell You.\" Pattanaik also explains the relevance of ancient narratives in today's world and sheds light on the often-overlooked stories of empowered women within Indian mythology.\n Let us talk about your growing years and the influences that nudged you to the world of myths and legends.\n Like many children of that time, I read Amar Chitra Katha and Chandamama comics. It is through them that I accessed mythology. I guess I had a natural inclination for religion, folklore, fantasy and philosophy. My parents never stopped me from buying books: everything from the Art of Boris Vallejo to the Bhagavatam by Kamala Subramaniam.\n From receiving formal training in medicine to becoming India's leading mythologist, what piqued your interest in the world of mythology?\n It’s only after I completed Medicine that my interest in mythology became intense and serious. It formed an escape from the world of healthcare, which I did not find particularly exciting.\n How did the journey unfold, what stimulated/encouraged it? \n I was always interested in mythology as a child, though I got more deeply interested in the subject during college. I wrote my first column related to mythology in college magazines. Then, following the interest of a publisher, I wrote my first (Shiva an introduction) book on mythology in 1996. That happened over 25 years ago. Mythology remained a parallel track to my job in the pharma industry until 2008. Then I took it up full-time thanks to the support of Mr. Kishore Biyani.\n Do you think mythology has relevance in today's world which is primed towards hard facts and logic? Especially, in the times when people go to court of law to decide on the existence of Lord Ram.\n Mythology reveals how people make sense of their world. It helps them to transmit their world-view to their children using stories, symbols and rituals. It is all about faith, belief and assumptions, which applies to all communities, past and present.\n As a mythologist how do you manage to navigate the tricky waters of interpreting myths with a modern rationale perspective and prospects of getting trolled/attacked for hurting religious sentiments?\n Trolling is a global phenomenon. It’s the result of the internet, which has expanded everyone’s desires, with no channel to satisfy these desires. It provides them with a lot of channels to direct their rage and frustration. Like pigeons who shit on us, we can do nothing about them. Hating them simply mirrors their stupidity. So I use the negative energy and turn it into positive energy by writing a book. The more they attack me, the more books I will write, and so while they sink into darkness, I will have a good time, and even more success, I hope.\n Folklore Vs Myth Vs Legends—Can you help us understand the difference?\n Folklore are stories about life that are passed through generations. Myths usually deal with the origin and end of the world, and hence are more spiritual. Legends are more political — they justify legitimising a community or their claim over a property or practice.\n You have delved into Greek mythology, Islamic mythology, Jewish mythology and Christian mythology. What are the points of similarity and differentiation amongst these?\n In Greek mythology, ‘god’ is shown as someone with extreme power, with no responsibility or accountability. The gods are usually highly competitive. They collaborate only when they have a common foe. Power is closely linked with this popular idea of god. Not kindness or compassion or wisdom.\n Power gets concentrated in one entity with Christian and Islamic mythologies. This is centralisation. This is the spiritual basis of feudalism. A central power to whom everyone is beholden. \n What triggered the need to do Sati, Savitri and other Feminist Tales They Don't Tell You? Indian mythology is replete with tales of strong women characters and their achievements that a lot of people are aware of. What is unique about this book?\n The book, \"Shikhandi\" told stories about queer people that I found when I was researching women's stories. This is part two of that book. In it, I want to draw attention to stories about women who have agency, power and are treated as equals or even superior in Hindu, Buddhist and Jain stories. These stories are not often told, and I wanted to bring that into perspective. \n When we say feminist tales do we have stories which explore the complex themes of matriarchy, sexuality and women rights etc. \n Feminism is not about women dominating men, it's about freedom at one level, where a woman is free to do what she wants. In a patriarchal society, that freedom is taken away from her and life is decided for her by men. We find stories in Indian mythology that speak of women's desires, women's choice of men, women having extramarital affairs and courtesans who provide sexual pleasure and have autonomous income. The younger generation is not taught about them.\n Which is your favourite story from the book? \n It is the story of Savitri, which was my mother's name, and it talks about a woman who outwits death and saves a man. Everybody tells the stories of how men rescue damsels in distress. We do not realize that one of the most popular stories in India is of a woman who rescues a man in distress. This story was written 2,000 years ago, so women don't need men to protect them, as one is constantly told by the media.\n\n",

    "content": " \n New Delhi: Think Change Forum (TCF), an independent think tank dedicated to generating new ideas and finding solutions for navigating through a new changing world recently held a panel discussion titled – Is it time for India to resurrect Indian Medical Services? The discussion highlighted the imperative of strengthening the public healthcare system and emphasized the pivotal role that Indian Medical Services (IMS) can play in achieving this objective.\n \n The panel comprised representatives from medical associations, public sector health institutions, and private medical sector. Names included Dr. Sharad Agarwal – National President, Indian Medical Association (IMA); Dr. Varuna Pathak - Former Professor of Gynecology & Obstetrics, Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal; Dr. Sita Naik - Professor and Head of the Department of Clinical Immunology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences; Dr. Vidur Jyoti – Senior Director & Head, Minimal Access & General Surgery, Max Hospital, Gurgaon; Dr. Rajesh Gupta - Additional Director, Pulmonology & Critical Care, Fortis Healthcare, Noida; Dr. SL Vig - Assistant Professor Community Medicine - ESIC Medical College Faridabad.\n \n Experts urged for the introduction of an elite cadre for medical experts under Indian Medical Services (IMS) akin to Indian Administrative Services (IAS).\n \n IMS will help bring the sheen and trust back to public health sector which has been lost to private sector; help stop brain drain from public medical services by attracting and retaining the best medical talent; allow for superior healthcare outcomes with better managed facilities and processes, as no longer generalists will be managing the specialists; reduce health crises and reduction in tertiary cases by improved preventive healthcare at primary levels; and last but not the least will enable seamless coordination between states and centre for healthcare policy making.\n \n IMS was present during the British era but was discontinued after India’s independence. The current government has made commendable efforts in healthcare and has implemented impactful schemes like Ayushman Bharat. However, still the gap is huge, requiring systemic changes.\n \n Expert panellists have proposed a ‘5-Point Agenda’ for bringing IMS back in India:\n \n Point No. 1 emphasizes an excessive reliance on private sector for meeting healthcare demands of Indian citizens. Overall, the healthcare infrastructure is fractured and falls short of providing quality and effective healthcare at scale. These shortcomings primarily stem from inefficient bureaucratic management rather than lack of skills among healthcare professionals. An IMS will help bring the sheen and trust back to public health sector which has been lost to private sector.\n \n Explaining this, Dr Rajesh Gupta said, “The majority of the Indian public relies on the private sector for healthcare services, with 60% of inpatient admissions (IPDs) and 80% of outpatient visits (OPDs) occurring in private facilities.”\n \n Dr. Varuna Pathak, elaborated further, \"Most of the time, we observe systemic failures in healthcare, which are not necessarily the fault of healthcare professionals but rather of the administrator who would typically be a generalist bureaucrat.”\n \n Dr. Vidur Jyoti said, “During the COVID-19 pandemic, the challenges and bottlenecks encountered in managing contingencies were primarily attributed to bureaucratic hurdles rather than any lack of commitment from healthcare professionals.”\n \n Point No. 2 highlighted challenges in staffing the public healthcare system with skilled doctors. Lack of incentives for these highly educated professionals to work under generalist administrators has resulted in brain drain. To retain quality doctors and ensure health security for the population, there is an urgent need to establish IMS which will help stop brain drain from public medical services by attracting and retaining the best medical talent.\n \n Dr. Sharad Kr Agarwal said, “The implementation of IMS holds the promise of enhancing service quality through induction of skilled doctors and addressing the persistent doctor shortage, especially in rural areas. Crucial to its success is equipping the cadre with ample facilities and resources comparable to those provided to IAS or IPS officers. This will ensure that doctors are incentivized to join IMS, drawn by a clear career trajectory and motivated to serve communities, even in remote areas.”\n \n Dr. SL Vig said, “For fresh medical graduates, the IMS can serve as a promising career path, commencing with postings at district or block levels. Advancement of opportunities within the cadre should be structured, allowing progression based on experience, from community health center (CSC) to district, state and eventually ministry levels.”\n \n The 3rd Point underscored the necessity of superior health outcomes for the citizens with better managed facilities and processes, which will happen when no longer generalists will be managing the specialists. Integrated Health Leadership, with leaders having both clinical capabilities and management capabilities is what a country like India uniquely needs, to efficiently manage healthcare systems ranging from grassroots to the tertiary levels.\n \n Dr. Sharad Agarwal explained, “We are advocating for the reinstatement of IMS because healthcare requires a unique approach distinct from other fields. The case for an IMS becomes even more apparent when observing successful private healthcare setups, wherein medical professionals adeptly balance both clinical expertise and administrative skills.”\n \n Dr. Sita Naik also suggested that, “There is a need to transform the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) into an all-India service in the form of IMS.”\n \n Point No. 4 focused on an urgent need to avert growing incidences of health crises and reduction in tertiary cases which can happen by improving preventive healthcare and delivery at primary healthcare levels. An effective IMS will enable this, which in turn reduce the cost of health for all stakeholders.\n \n Explaining this, Dr. Vidur Jyoti said, “The need for change in medical services in India lies in the fact that the essentials of healthcare are being overlooked. We are essentially moving into disease management and are neglecting health management which has put immense pressure on the tertiary system. In healthcare, the essentials are knowledge acquisition, deployment and application which require constant updating, unlearning and relearning. To effectively manage these complexities it is necessary to have dedicated medical service officers in the country.”\n \n Dr. SL Vig said, “Along with primary care we need to offer primordial prevention and primary prevention also. To give an example – a lot of issues faced by the lower class can be prevented before they are escalated to critical health issues.”\n \n Point No. 4 highlights that an IMS will be able to enable seamless coordination and cooperation between the central and state health departments, for improved national healthcare policies for the country.\n \n Dr. SL Vig elaborated on this, “Respecting the constitutional framework, let's preserve health as a state subject while introducing the IMS. Similar to other central services, the IMS cadre can serve as a force multiplier to implement central healthcare policies and schemes, customizing them to meet the unique healthcare requirements at the state and community levels.”\n\n",

This targets deceased, relocated, and duplicate voters to ensure integrity of the electoral process, the district election officer said on Wednesday.\n\n \n  Efforts to uphold the purity of the electoral roll have been ongoing, with a focus on adhering to Election Commission of India (ECI) guidelines and ensuring equitable access to polling stations, according to an official release. Since January 2023, a comprehensive effort has led to the removal of 47,141 deceased voters, 4,39,801 relocated voters, and 54,259 duplicate voters.\n \n \n  This cleanup process, carried out in accordance with ECI directives, involved meticulous adherence to procedural requirements. Additionally, efforts were made to rectify discrepancies such as \"non-standard\" house numbers on the electoral roll, with corrections applied to 1,81,405 voter records in Hyderabad district.\n \n \n  Another vital initiative aimed to consolidate split voters within families into single polling stations, resulting in 3,78,713 corrections to facilitate voter participation.

As India gears up for the world’s largest democratic election this year with over 20 million1 young first time voters, this initiative is a call to action, reminding young adults, especially first time voters, to take full advantage of their fundamental civic right: the right to vote.\n \n With mention of the term \"Voting\" increasing by nearly 3x on Tinder Bios in India in the last year1, Tinder is introducing in-app voting-themed stickers such as 'Voting Partner Needed', 'First-time Voter', and 'I Voted' for users to display on their profiles.2 These stickers allow users on Tinder to showcase their passion and foster connections with like-minded individuals. \n \n Starting April 18 and until May 15, 2024, Tinder users in India will see \"Swipe Cards\" appearing in-app on Tinder (visuals below) highlighting the process and tips. Each Swipe Card will direct the relevant Tinder user to the Mark Your Presence website for information on voter registration and how to complete the process. \n \n In a recent survey by Yuvaa, the message from young adults is crystal clear: being politically engaged isn't merely a checkbox—it's a highly desirable trait for young adults in India. When it comes to dating preferences and voting habits, 60% of GenZ respondents strongly prefer dating someone who votes and almost 1 in 3 of surveyed young adults expressed that they would find a potential match more attractive if they know the person is taking the elections seriously.3 Moreover, 79% of GenZ respondents are more likely to vote if accompanied by a friend or date showing how important it is to have someone to go and vote with.3\n \n Chaitanya Prabhu, Founder, Mark Your Presence says, I'm thrilled about our partnership with Tinder and Yuvaa. Together, we share a collective dream of empowering young voices and celebrating their right to vote. By providing voter registration opportunities alongside avenues for personal expression, we're not just encouraging individual involvement, we are fueling a shared movement as millions of first-time voters prepare for the elections.”\n \n Aahana Dhar, Tinder’s Communications Director in India, said “Over half of Tinder’s users are aged between 18 to 25 years old 4 and this collaboration is a great opportunity to encourage younger and newer voters to go to the ballot. We know young daters are passionate about key events that impact their lives and Tinder is giving them a way to express their intent directly in their profile with voting stickers, apart from raising awareness about voter registration for first timers.” \n \n “In our conversations with young adults in India, we've observed a genuine concern about their civic responsibilities, which significantly shapes their connections with one another. At Yuvaa, we've always championed the importance of empowering youth voices. That's why we're delighted to collaborate with Tinder and Mark Your Presence encouraging young people to consider how they can actively participate as informed citizens.” said Maanvi, Editor-in-Chief, Yuvaa\n \n \n How to add stickers to your profile on Tinder: \n\n\n Tinder users can add stickers to their profile by tapping on in-app push notifications they receive. These stickers can be changed or accessed again by tapping on another user’s sticker on their profile.*\n \n 1 Special Summary Revision 2024 by Election Commission of India issued by Press Information Bureau, Delhi\n 2 From Tinder bios in India between January 2023 - February 2024\n 3 A survey of 253 18-24 year olds across Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata conducted by Yuvaa between 5th to 12th April 2024\n 4 Tinder internal Swipe & Match data 2023 \n � * These stickers are within the app and can only be used one way\n\n",

But today Delhi is not far, you are in Delhi's heart.” He noted the significant improvement in connectivity to Delhi, once a distant dream for many in Assam, now made accessible through improved infrastructure and connectivity measures.\n He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi alone has taken more visits to northeastern states than previous Prime Ministers combined.\n \"All PMs together have not taken 70 visits as much as PM Modi...In the last 10 years, Union Ministers made visits to the northeast 680 times. PM Modi called northeast 'Ashta Lakshmi', what are those 'Ashta Aadhar? first, peace....second...hydropower generation, third, tourism; fourth, 5G connectivity, fifth, culture; sixth, natural farming...seventh, sports and eighth was to nourish the potential\" he said.\n Meanwhile the election commission has completed the preparation for the first phase of polling on five Lok Sabha seats on Friday.\n The Chief Electoral Officer of Assam, Anurag Goel said that all the vehicles carrying EVMs will be equipped with GPS tracking devices and satellite phones will be made available in far-flung areas. “We have arranged GPS tracking of all the vehicles that will be carrying EVMs and this will be monitored by the District Election Officer, CEO, and Election Commission.

We visited the sets. The film aims to present an honest portrayal of Kashmir beyond the stereotypes traditionally seen on the silver screen. The film will highlight the untold history of Kashmir, spanning over 100 years from the early 1920s to today unlike what was shown in Kashmir Files.\n         Veteran actor Raza Murad will be seen playing - Syed Salahuddin the head of Hizbul Mujahideen in, ‘Kashmir – Enigma of Paradise’ which is directed by Atul Garg.\n         Excerpts\n         Will Raza Murad be hated for playing - Syed Salahuddin the head of Hizbul Mujahideen in ‘Kashmir – Enigma of Paradise’?\n         I have been playing the negative characters throughout my career. I am not playing a Pakistani character for the first time. I played a Pakistani character even in the film, ‘Heena’. The audiences have become very intelligent. They watch how you have justified the role. Negative characters like Gabbar Singh and Mugambo were very popular. Shatrughan Sinha was one of the most well-known villains.\n         On the dearth of Villains today\n         There is no dearth of villains in the industry. The characterisation of the villain is not done the way it was done earlier. In those days, they would be portrayed as totally black while in today’s times they are shown powerful. The portrayal of that degree of hatred is missing. \n         \n         Today’s actors concentrate more on building their six packs and work less on their craft and voice\n         I agree 100 percent. Ironically, most actors of the recent times are stressing more on making their muscles or a six pack body. That is the latest trend. In entirety, they only concentrate on developing their body physically. Only a few pay little attention to developing their craft and also on improving their diction, especially Hindi. If only your physical was enough to become a star, Every Mr. Universe and Mr. World would have become a super star by now. Working here in this artistic field we need to be able to excel in our craft. Professing good health and being as fit as a fiddle is indeed a great attitude. But only building a body will not help you become a good actor. An assimilation of good vocals, keeping a control on your voice along with your acting capabilities will help you turn into an exuberant actor.\n         Maidaan and BMCM with huge stars are not doing well. Your take on stardom\n         Ultimately, films may or may not work. Koi Duniya ka actor yeh dawa nahi kar sakta ki main film chala sakta hoon,aisa nahi hota[No actor can claim to run the film on his stardom] Any film works on totality, it depends on the making and how far you can keep the nerve of the public in control. Also, you never know the film may pick up slowly and gradually. Success or no success of films is like, a T20 cricket match. First day and second day collections and week end collections vary. At times, films take a slow start and pick up later on, while a few films pick up on the first day itself and then drop gradually. I think we need to wait and watch. According to the initial box office reports, these films are below expectations. I have not seen these films, but read all the reviews and observing the box office too. If a film runs at the B.O it does benefit the entire film industry.\n         Ajay Devgn’s film,” Maidaan” is based on the coach of a huge football legend. We Indians have a keen interest in Cricket in comparison to Football and Hockey. This film is based on football which is played in a few States only.

Besides crude oil, India spent $23.4 billion on import of 48.1 million tonnes of petroleum products like LPG. It also exported 62.2 million tonnes of products for $47.4 billion,” the PPAC data showed.\nOther than oil, India also imports gas in its liquid form, called LNG. After the price shock of 2022-23, import of 30.91 billion cubic metres of gas cost $13.3 billion in FY24. This compared with $17.1 billion spent on import of 26.3 bcm of gas in 2022-23 when energy prices shot up to record levels in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nThe net oil and gas import bill (crude oil plus petroleum product plus LNG import bill minus exports) stood at $121.6 bn in 2023-24, down from $144.2 bn, data showed.\nPetroleum imports as percentage of India’s gross imports (in value terms) stood at 25.1 per cent, down from 28.2 per cent in 2022-23. Similarly, petroleum exports as a percentage of the country's gross exports came at 12 per cent in 2023-24 as compared to 14 per cent in the previous year,” the PPAC data showed.",

Nutritionists, while welcoming the growth of vegetable juices, warn against taking it too far with juice-only diets.&amp;#13;�Visakhapatnam: Scorching heat wave has already arrived as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD). However, delicious seasonal fruits have also arrived in the markets as per schedule, offering a sweet escape from the heat.\nIce apples, popular as tati munjulu, are a popular choice of people going through the summer heat for the fruit’s refreshing tarty flavour. At Rs 70 per dozen, they are a pocket-friendly option. These little powerhouses are packed with vitamins and minerals, perfect for beating the heat and keeping one hydrated.\nJackfruit is another summer staple, available for Rs 50 a dozen. It can be enjoyed ripe or unripe. Watermelon, the summer saviour, is a steal at Rs 30 per kilogram. Many restaurants and cafes are incorporating watermelons into their menus to attract clientele.\nReigning supreme, however, is the king of fruits, the mango. Its prices range from Rs 150–200 per kilogram depending on the variety. The higher prices of certain fruits have put them out of reach of those on a tight budget.\nOwner of Visakhapatnam's popular juice shop in MVP colony told Deccan Chronicle, \"I have been serving cool juices as a relief from heat for the past 15 years. Watermelon sharbat and mango juice are our stars, with some opting for papaya juice too. The price of watermelon juice is only Rs 20 a cup, so it's easy on the wallet. Papaya juice is Rs 40. Mangoes are not on our menu yet due to their high price. We may offer them next week.\" ",

    "content": " Supreme Court of India. (PTI File Image)Supreme Court of India. (PTI File Image)\n In a significant development in a more than decade-old case, the Supreme Court has handed a major victory to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) by overturning its earlier directive. Previously, the apex court had ordered DMRC to pay an arbitration award of Rs 8,000 crore to Anil Ambani’s firm, Delhi Airport Metro Express Ltd (DAMEPL).\n The court’s reversal is a damning indictment of the arbitral process, citing a “huge miscarriage of justice”. Consequently, the execution proceedings in the Delhi high court were halted, and DMRC was absolved of the obligation to make the exorbitant payment. Moreover, the court directed the refund of amounts already deposited by DMRC, aiming to restore both parties to their pre-verdict positions.\n The legal dispute originated from a “concession agreement” dating back to 2008, governing the construction, operation and maintenance of the Delhi Airport Metro Express line. Tensions escalated when DAMEPL terminated the contract in 2012, claiming “unresolved structural defects by DMRC”. In the ensuing legal battle, DAMEPL won in 2017, leaving DMRC with an exorbitant liability of Rs 8,000 crore-plus to be paid to the Anil Ambani firm. Now, that case is closed. \n But the ruling does underscore one important aspect for us to ponder — the unpredictability and complexity inherent in arbitration disputes involving government entities and private firms. A case that dragged on for 12 years also shows how slow and meandering the judicial processes in India. Even more significantly, it prompts serious reflection on the accountability and transparency of government babus in presenting their case effectively and fairly, especially in matters of public interest and significant financial implications.\n Forest officers call for probe into colleague’s death\n The Indian Forest Service (IFoS) officers are deeply troubled by the recent suicide of a colleague in Meghalaya. The chief conservator of forests, N. Luikham, tragically took his own life by hanging in his official residence recently. This unfortunate event has sparked a demand from the central unit of the IFoS Association for a thorough probe into the circumstances leading to Luikham’s death, and for accountability for those who may have contributed to his decision.\n Sources informed DKB that the association secretary-general, Suneesh Buxy, has written to Meghalaya chief secretary Donland Phillips Wahlang, claiming that Luikham had been falsely accused by a junior colleague last month of sexually harassing her and was under stress and mental trauma because of these allegations. Mr Buxy, reportedly, attributed these allegations to pressure from a powerful mining lobby against whom Luikham had taken a stand. Despite an inquiry yielding no substantive evidence against the officer, the damage to his reputation had been done.\n The ramifications of the officer’s death are felt deeply by the entire IFoS community, resonating as a blow to the morale of officers nationwide. The association has called for a CBI investigation into Luikham’s suicide. The officer’s erstwhile colleagues insist on swift and decisive action to hold accountable any individuals found to have played a role in perpetuating the circumstances that led to the tragedy.\n EC pressures Gujarat govt to fill key IPS positions\n The Election Commission of India (ECI) has put the spotlight on the Gujarat government. With the nomination for 26 Lok Sabha seats and five Assembly seats underway, the poll panel has directed the state government to swiftly submit a list of IPS officers to fill vacant positions in the state immediately.\n This move comes in the wake of the model code of conduct being enforced, which mandates that state governments seek the Election Commission’s approval before making any appointments or promotions. Such measures aim to prevent any undue influence on the election process.\n The vacancy situation in key posts, including the Surat police commissioner and three range inspector-generals, along with positions like superintendent of police of Kheda and Mehsana, has been lingering for more than two months. The delay, observers say, is attributed to various factors, such as four IPS officers proceeding on Central deputation last year and five officers being placed on leave reserve by the Election Commission due to their extended postings in a single Lok Sabha constituency for three years.\n Of course, another factor for the delay, which is obviously not mentioned, is that senior Gujarat government appointments are made only after a green signal from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). But now with the Election Commission at the helm, the appointments will be implemented swiftly.\n\n",

    "content": " �Hyderabad: A two-judge panel of the Telangana High Court, comprising Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice J Anil Kumar, directed the state government to seek instructions as to when the post of president to the state consumer redressal commission will be filled. The post has been lying vacant since the retirement of former president M.S.K. Jaiswal. The panel was dealing with a PIL filed by a practising advocate of the High Court, Baglekar Akash Kumar, who appeared party in person contending that the general administration department (GAD), Government of Telangana, and the Telangana State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited had failed to fill up the post of president in Telangana State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. Earlier the procedure for the appointment of the president was in consultation with the Chief Justice of the state. However, the apex court put in a selection process for retired High Court judges who aspire to hold the post. On an earlier occasion, the court was informed that a review petition was filed in the apex court and an order was awaited. The state government sought time to seek instructions regarding the same to appraise the court. The matter has been adjourned to June 10 for further action.\nNo bar on notice proposing no-trust vote against municipal chief: HC\nJustice T. Vinod Kumar of the Telangana High Court ruled that a notice proposing to conduct a no-confidence motion moved against any chairperson of the municipal council during subsistence of the election code issued for the general elections is not barred by law. The judge made the observation while dealing with a writ plea filed by R. Vijayalakshmi, chairperson of Kollapur municipal council, Nagarkurnool district. The petitioner challenged a notice issued by the Nagarkurnool district collector and election officer proposing to conduct the meeting for considering the no-confidence motion moved against the petitioner during the subsistence of the election code issued for the Lok Sabha elections. The standing counsel, appearing for the municipal corporation, informed the court that there is no provision in the act that prohibits continuing with no-confidence motion during the General elections. The judge accordingly closed the writ petition.\nAlwal MRO directed to inquire into mutations\nJustice B. Vijaysen Reddy of the Telangana High Court directed the Alwal MRO to conduct denovo inquiry into the mutations carried out with regard to 24 acres of land at Kowkur village, Alwal. The court was dealing with a writ petition filed by Gopal Krishna constructions, a realtor company, contending that the MRO conducted the mutation proceedings in lands owned by it without giving any notice. The mutation was carried out in favour of the legal representatives of the original owner who had already sold the land to the petitioner company. The petitioner alleged fraud and misrepresentation and demanded a fresh inquiry by giving due notices to it. The court accordingly allowed the writ petition directing a fresh inquiry.",

    "content": "  \n Ditch the GPS and have fun navigating the streets through an artistic gaze – the old clocktower, a cluster of colourful houses on the left, three stacked stones around the bend, a giant banyan tree in the centre, an old chai tapri at the crossroads — as landmark points to locate a particular place! Within these seemingly chaotic spaces in India whether on streets, natural trails or inside a metro mall lies the subconscious art of wayfinding. Striking a balance between intuitive navigation and individual discovery, wayfinding art is a visual indication through signage, textures, colour schemes, landmark sculptures, street art etc that help you navigate spaces and allow you to reach your destination effortlessly. Namita Jain, a Pune-based wayfinding and signage designer says, “It can be perceived as the art of wayfinding or a way of finding through art. People are constantly on the move and in such a hurry. We take time to read or write hence, we always take visual cues to help us navigate effortlessly and effectively.”  \n Ancient Wisdom  \n India’s history is intertwined with the evolution of navigation, from ancient pilgrimage routes to modern urban planning. The art of wayfinding is intricately woven into the architecture of India’s temples. Temples are often constructed according to principles of sacred geometry, aligning with cardinal directions and celestial bodies. The entrance (gopuram) often features elaborate sculptures and carvings, acting as both a decorative element and a navigational guide. The inner sanctum (garbhagriha) is strategically placed to capture the first rays of the sun during specific times of the year. This celestial alignment not only adds a spiritual dimension to the architecture but also aids in determining the time of day, contributing to the practical aspects of wayfinding within the temple premises. Wayfinding is not just about information systems but also about site-specific experiences where identification, direction, information, and regulation become one of the primary motives. Whether it is to read ‘No Smoking’ signs, footprints at metro stations or identify a happening place through its famous clock tower.  \n Modern Wayfinding  \n In contemporary India, the art of wayfinding has evolved to meet the demands of urbanisation. Cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kolkata are bustling metropolises where navigating the chaotic streets requires a unique set of skills. Street art, including colourful murals, graffiti... Public spaces are adorned  \n with street art that not only beautifies the surroundings but also serves as visual innuendo for navigation. The Lodhi art district in Delhi serves as a landmark for many where friends would mark it as a ‘meeting’ point. \n Art And Beyond  \n The subconscious art of wayfinding is an amalgamation of conscious choices of materials involved, font and choices etc. Pulkit Sudan (30), a wayfinding and signage designer says, “Colours form the basis of designing artworks and graphics for wayfinding systems. We ensure that there’s enough contrast and legibility through basic colour theory. We also follow some cultural standards of what colour denotes danger or stop etc.” He emphasises the significance of the quality of material that is used in creating surroundings, “Suppose if a person comes to an unfamiliar city/place where all the signs are made of metal and painted in a warm colour like yellow, orange. Usually, people will see that as a warm sign however, a visually impaired person will perceive the city as a very cold place because it is made of metal. So you can change the material to make the person feel warmer, colder, sharper, or more soft based on the perception of that space.” This plays a very crucial role in indoor spaces as visually impaired people are self-reliant in indoor spaces as compared to outdoors where they are assisted. \n Apart from colour and texture, even fonts play a key role in creating a seamless navigation experience. “There are certain guidelines which are based on legibility, and readability. The speed limit for drivers determines the font height and size on the sign board. Similarly, the height, position and angle of branded boards are kept in mind keeping the viewers in mind that will catch more eyes. And once you determine how tall the building is, you decide on legible and readable fonts,” says Namita. Different settings require different fonts. Fonts used for hotel rooms will be very different from public spaces that cater to a larger audience. Roadway sign boards are typically in green or blue due to international standards for road signs. Green is often used for directional signs, and blue is common for motorway or expressway signs, ensuring visibility and consistency. \n Aesthetics & Functionality \n Pulkit points out that wayfinding art is not the job of one person. It needs to strike a balance between functionality and artistic choices. As Namita says, “It is even to create navigational experiences that you just organically or through osmosis remember it now as.” Wayfind-ing art is registered subconsciously in everyone’s life where the idea is to build a memory and create a recall value for the same. A good wayfinding system is an amalgamation of conscious choices made by experts to create a seamlessly beautiful and functional navigation experience. \n People are constantly on the move and in such a hurry. We take time to read or write hence, we always take visual cues to help us navigate effortlessly and effectively.” — Namita Jain, wayfinding and signage designer \n Colours form the basis of designing artworks and graphics for wayfinding systems. We ensure that there's enough contrast and legibility through basic colour theory.” — Pulkit Sudan (30), wayfinding and signage designer \n",

    "content": "  \n In an era where cases of children and senior citizens suffering from dementia and Alzheimer’s disease going missing are on the rise, 24-year-old Akshay Ridlan, a Mumbai-based data engineer, has embarked on a noble initiative aimed at leveraging technology for social good. His brainchild, Project Chetna, is not just a product but a solution designed to ensure the safety and well-being of vulnerable individuals across India. Akshay explains, “This product is actually for a social cause. It is purely to serve Bharat and make it surakshit and, you know, digital Bharat.”  \n Distressing statistics which show that one lakh children go missing annually in India compelled him to take action. “Why not use technology and Artificial Intelligence to overcome this problem,” he asked himself. \n His initiative operates on a simple premise. Individuals can register on the website, providing crucial details about themselves or their loved ones. Upon submission, all pertinent information is securely stored on a tag, accessible to authorised personnel. Akshay emphasises the paramount importance of data security, ensuring that only authorised users can access the information. \n Akshay and his team have distributed 5000 pendants for free so far, to special children and elderly people suffering from dementia. “We distributed the pendants to the All-India Railwaymen’s Federation (AIRF) union of retired people,” adds Akshay. \n The recent tracing of 12-year-old Vinayak Kohli, an autistic child, underscores the effectiveness of this project. When Vinayak went missing, the police swiftly scanned his tag and retrieved Akshay’s details as an emergency contact. Within hours, Vinayak was safely reunited with his family. \n “One day Vinayak was playing near our house and somehow reached the bus stop and boarded a bus. The conductor kept asking him where he lived and where he wanted to go. But Vinay, being an autistic child, was not able to answer. The conductor then took him to the Colaba Police Station. The Police too questioned Vinay, but in vain. They then spotted the pendant on Vinayak’s neck. They scanned the QR code, where they found Akshay Ridlan’s number and were then connected to us. We found Vinayak solely because of the pendant. We are very grateful,” shares Shraddha Kohli, Vinayak’s mother.  \n As an advocate for societal advancement through technology, Akshay envisions a future where innovative solutions like his redefine social welfare. “We are here to define technology for society,” he declares, urging everyone to join the mission and contribute to building a safer, more connected India. \n Akshay Ridlan and Project Chetna stand as beacons of hope, leveraging technology to protect and empower those in need. \n Individuals can register on the website, providing crucial details about themselves or their loved ones. Upon submission, all pertinent information is securely stored on a tag, accessible to authorised personnel. \n “We distributed the pendants to the All-India Railwaymen’s Federation (AIRF) union of retired people.” — Akshay Ridlan \n",

Devotees thronged temples and pandals and participated in the divine celebrations commemorating the birth of Lord Rama. \n\n   \n The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams marked the festivities with a ceremonial Dhwajarohanam at the Sri Kodanda Rama Swamy temple in Vontimitta, Kadapa district, signalling the commencement of the annual Brahmotsavams. The temple is set to celebrate the auspicious Sri Sita Ramula Vari Kalyanam on April 22. \n  \n At the hill shrine of Lord Venkateswara in Tirumala, TTD observed Sri Rama Navami Asthanam ritual. After the daily rituals, temple priests performed the sacred ‘Snapana Tirumanjanam’ to the idols of Lord Sri Rama, Lakshmana, Sita, and Hanuman.  \n   \n Later in the day, the deity was taken out in a procession through the mada streets on Hanumantha Vahanam. Later, the pundits read out ‘Sri Rama Jananam’ in Sri Rama Navami Asthanam, which took place near Bangaru Vakili inside the hill temple at around 10pm. \n   \n The Sri Kodanda Rama temple in Tirupati witnessed similar celestial fervour, with a Snapana Tirumanjanam performed in the morning and an Asthanam in the evening. \n   \n The Pedda Jeeyar Swamy of Tirumala presented new Vastrams to the presiding and Utsava deities, followed by Rama's celestial ride on Hanumantha Vahana. \n   \n Meanwhile, Hindu shrines across the state celebrated the Sri Sita-Ramulavari Kalyanam in a grand manner, attracting devotees in large numbers.

    "content": "  \n In the last couple of days, three different types of forecasts have come in which reveal that India’s economy would perform better in the current financial year that ends in March 2025. The first and the most important forecast was from the Indian meteorological department (IMD). It expects the country to receive above-normal rainfall during the rainy season which begins when the monsoon sets in over Kerala on June 1. As a large majority of the Indian population still depends on agriculture, normal rainfall is crucial from both economical and social perspectives in the country.  \n The second forecast was from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which suggests that the Indian economy would grow faster in fiscal 2025. Predicting a strong growth in domestic demand and growing working population in the country, IMF revised its growth forecast for India upwards from the previous 6.5 per cent to 6.8 per cent and said that India will continue to be the world’s fastest growing major economy. \n The third forecast was deduced from the meetings of the US Federal Reserve in March, where its members expressed concern over stubborn inflation and hinted at going slow on slashing its interest rate. While it does not concern India directly, it has an indirect impact on it. It is believed that higher inflation eats into the value of currency. So a higher inflation would depreciate the US dollar against other currencies including the rupee. But to keep their currencies competitive, other countries would let their currencies depreciate further. So if India is forced to take this route and let the rupee lose its value further, it will lead to an increase in the price of all imported goods, including fuel and gold. If the US wants to fight its inflation, it is good for India. A cut in the US interest rate, on the other hand, would have brought more hot money into already super-hot Indian stock markets and flush Indian banks with hoards of deposits, creating a problem of plenty, which is best avoided as the Indian economy is stable with decent economic growth and manageable inflation.  \n",

Balakrishna allegedly offered to kill Amareswar for money and assembled a group to carry out the act. The accused persons lured Amareswar to Vepagunta under the pretence of a meeting and assaulted him by pelting stones, from Pinagadi road to the burial ground in Srikrishnapuram.\nOn April 15, police arrested the accused persons in Vepagunta after receiving a tip-off and seized several vehicles, mobile phones, and the weapons used in the crime.",

    "content": "  \n On April 18, the 17th-century Bansilalpet stepwell will be illuminated with strings of lights, and guests will be mesmerised by the “Shanmata” performance, which revolves around the worship of six principal Hindu deities: Shiva, Vishnu, Shakti, Ganesha, Surya, and Skanda. \n Stepwells that have been neglected are being renovated to serve as social and cultural centres for the neighbourhood, as well as a supply of water. No matter how much we believe we understand about this genre, there is always more to discover.  \n This is where a group of heritage influencers tell stories about nearly extinct cultural traditions or underexplored heritage sites. \n “The country has thousands of stepwells that are several hundred years old. Telangana State has 300 step wells. Maharashtra has over 18000 stepwells. Bansilalpet stepwell was revived after an 18-month effort. The success story of Bansilalpet stepwell restoration resonated in New Delhi, and they have invited us to restore 150-year-old step well in Rashtrapati Nilayam in Hyderabad,” says Kalpana Ramesh, architect and head of the Rainwater Project.  \n Documenting lesser-known heritage monuments \n Maroof Umar ‘Culmen’, a heritage storyteller, has expanded his work beyond borders. His passion for Awadhi culture, art, and architecture inspired him to launch his Instagram profile in 2021, which resulted in viral videos, celebrity recognition, and awards for his work. In his short films, he documents lesser-known Lucknow heritage monuments such as Bilehra Fort or Butler Palace. \n “My journey into content creation centred around heritage and culture was primarily motivated by my concerns about overtourism. This phenomenon often leads to a few famous landmarks being overrun by tourists while many lesser-known historical sites are left neglected, gradually deteriorating and risking oblivion,” says Umar, a graphic designer and Instagram photographer who has a body of collaborative work across platforms such as Google and National Geographic. \n Talking about the hidden gem the ‘Makka Darzi ka Imambara’ at Khairabad, some two hours from Lucknow, Umar says, “This secret gem was created by a tailor who specialised in making European-style clothing for Awadh’s King, Naseer ud din Haider. He supported the development of this lovely Imambara with his little earnings. What distinguishes this site is its elaborate stucco work, which demonstrates the artisan’s talent and dedication. I really believe that increasing awareness of such underappreciated monuments is critical. It not only aids in their preservation, but it also improves their accessibility, allowing more people to visit and appreciate their historical value.”  \n Spicing up history with anecdotes \n Umair Shah, 27, is a numismatist, an Instagram influencer, and a self-confessed ‘history nerd’. “The use of Instagram and heritage walks demonstrates a commitment to sharing this knowledge with a wider audience,” says Shah, who leads heritage walking excursions in the old districts of Delhi-NCR and western Uttar Pradesh. Shah, a skilled numismatist, spiced up his history tours with anecdotes he discovered while collecting coins. “Most people go to monuments to take selfies or dance on a reel. But I want them to realise what more the place offers.” \n Delhi is rich in history, with magnificent forts and frightening graves. “Compared to the more famous Kutub Minar complex, Mehrauli Archaeological Park and its monuments are relatively unknown. The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has restored the park, including the repair of Shah Quli Khan’s tomb and the establishment of a cafe nearby. Kuli Khan’s tomb was originally that of Akbar’s foster brother, but it was later taken over by a British agent, Thomas Metcalfe, who converted it into his summer home. He used to spend time there, smoke hookah, and even construct a boat house with a lake within the park,” says Shah.  \n Discussing the importance of coinage as a tangible window to the past, providing historical insights on rulers and events.  \n “They emphasise the importance of coins in storytelling and historical documentation, citing instances such as those produced by Nadir Shah during his invasion of Delhi in 1739,” says Shah, better known by his Instagram moniker, Sikkawala.  \n ‘heritage is my identity’  \n Rameen Khan’s CityTales tries to recreate it by conducting modern-day baithaks — storytelling sessions infused with Ghalib, Mir Taqi Mir, Sufi mystiques, and Mughal history centred on the walled city. Rameen feels that narrative in the true Kissa-Goi format can bring a monument’s material fabric alive. “I love reading about history and visiting historical sites. The reason I began talking and writing about it was that so much fake history is being spread via WhatsApp with no basis in truth and that popular media concentrates solely on the most popular monuments in big cities such as Delhi, Agra, and Lucknow. I wanted to discuss the heritage of small towns, which has not been protected and is in a far more fragile state,” says Rameen adding, “Even in the case of the most popular monuments, the reported stories were unidimensional. I wanted to reveal more layers. For example, the historic Purana Qila in Delhi was used as a refugee camp during partition in 1947. Or that Humayun’s tomb witnessed the arrest of the final Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, marking the end of the Mughal empire.” \n Stepwells are brilliant pieces of architecture that represent both our past and future. and every citizen has a duty to take pride in and uphold our rich cultural legacy.” — Sudha Reddy, director of Meil, celebrates World Heritage Day at Bansilalpet Stepwell. \n The use of Instagram and heritage walks demonstrates a commitment to sharing this knowledge with a wider audience. — Umair Shah, numismatist, an Instagram influencer, and a self-confessed ‘history nerd’ \n The success story of Bansilalpet stepwell restoration resonated in New Delhi, and they have invited us to restore a one-year-old step well in Rashtrapati Nilayam in Hyderabad. — Kalpana Ramesh, architect and head of the Rainwater Project \n",

    "content": " Tribals of around a dozen villages marched to the forest to free their kin from custody of the MaoistsTribals of around a dozen villages marched to the forest to free their kin from custody of the Maoists\n In the first 100 days of 2024, 46 Naxals were killed compared to just 22 in the whole of 2023 and 30 the year before. And then it exploded with around 37 Maoists being gunned down in the Hapatola forest of Chhattisgarh’s Kanker area on April 16 suggesting that the decreasing number of encounters in 2023 and the first part of 2024 may have been deceptive as to the existence and extent of the problem in the country, especially in the Bastar region.\n In the biggest operation against Naxals this year and in which the exchange of gunfire lasted two hours, security forces belonging to District Reserve Guard (DRG) and Border Security Force (BSF) also killed senior commander Shankar Rao, who had a bounty of Rs 25 lakhs on his head. \n The detection and recovery of a huge cache of weapons and ammunition after the operation would also suggest that nothing can be taken for granted in the vigil on armed violence against India, principally from Maoists.\n There is little doubt that progress had been made since 2015 when the tone and tenor of operations against Naxals took on an unambiguous government thrust to tackle the problem that may have been allowed to grow and then fester for decades due to indistinct messaging from the previous Central political leadership. Naxal activity hit a peak in 2010 with 1,005 deaths recorded on both sides.\n The velvet glove process was never going to solve the problem though the need for addressing the social conditions leading to resistance building to the concept of nation has never gone away. The fact is despite any efforts at improving the lot of the largely tribal people who live in the belt in central India, the problem of indoctrination of the young and a fight against the symbols of state was never likely to go away.\n Better coordination between the Centre and the state and Central forces taking up their vigil, including in forward positions facilitating quicker response than in the old days when advance warnings of the movements of forces led to ambushes, in the violence-hit pockets filled with revolutionary ideologues has resulted in tighter control over the movement of Maoists.\n It can be said that the fruits of the growing economy should reach everyone so that there is no pocket of disgruntlement and disaffection that allows such movements to spring up. But any rebels who take up violence to protest against the State and its symbols of power, including telecommunications towers, as the Maoists do even as they gun down innocent civilians, must be taken head-on for the preservation of the security of the citizen and sustain the rule of law.\n If there have been signs of increasing hostilities between the Maoists and police forces in 2024, it may be a sign that the former are getting more desperate and itching for action as the civilian population is being won over by the forces that are doing a fine job in standing up to the rebels who are known to use diverse bullying tactics to keep the local population from cooperating with the police forces. The iron fist must prevail to keep the rebellion at bay.\n",

Nominations will be accepted till April 25.\nThe nomination papers would be scrutinised on April 26 and the last date for the withdrawal of nominations is April 29.

It is expected to declare candidates for the remaining three seats — Khammam, Karimnagar and Hyderabad — in a day or two.\nCongress candidates have decided to file nominations between April 19 and 23, considering them 'auspicious' as suggested by astrologers.\nBJP leaders D.K.

It is enough if one person nominates the candidates of recognized political parties, but 10 people have to nominate unrecognised political parties and independent candidates.\nAlong with the nomination, an affidavit should be filed through Form-26, and educational qualifications, cases and criminal antecedents must be included in this affidavit. Candidates must be 25 years of age. Before the nomination, a bank account should be opened in any national bank for managing the expenses of the election and the bank account details should be submitted before the nomination.\nThe CEO also issued certain guidelines to contest candidates and political parties asking not to violate Model Code of Conduct. He also asked district collectors and superintendents of police to implement model code of conduct strictly in the state.

The second to have jumped the BRS ship is Aroori Ramesh, a former BRS MLA who switched to the BJP and was equally promptly rewarded by the BJP, which declared him as its candidate in Warangal.\nThe fast developments in Warangal led to some serious consternation in the BRS and its leaders slammed Kavya, and her father and senior BRS leader Kadiam Srihari, who too joined the Congress along with his daughter on March 31, and accused them of backstabbing their parent party.

Jagan Mohan Reddy in Vijayawada on Saturday as “self-inflicted to garner sympathy” have fallen flat on Wednesday.\nParty candidate from Vijayawada Central, Bonda Uma, revealed that a resident of a local basti has admitted he threw a stone on the Chief Minister out of sheer anger. The anger, according to Uma, emanated from the state government’s decision to close down the “Anna Canteens”, an initiative of the Chandrababu Naidu-led government to supply meals at Rs.5 each.\nUma, speaking to a vernacular television channel, also said the suspect, said to be in police custody, was also upset over the YSRC leaders failing to keep their promise of paying him money and serving liquor for attending the CM’s road show.\n“Uma’s revelation clearly exposed the double standards of the TD and Chandrababu Naidu. Till now, they tried to project that the ruling party orchestrated the attack to gain sympathy and now, when the truth is about to come out, the party changed its version,” alleged the YSRC spokesperson.\nEver since the Chief Minister sustained injury, the TD leaders took to social media ridiculing the attack as “kodi katti 2.0”, citing that the ruling party enacted a similar attack on Jagan Mohan Reddy before the 2019 polls, with a knife, in Visakhapatnam airport.\nThough TD chief Nara Chandrababu Naidu condemned the attack and demanded an unbiased probe, his son and party general secretary Nara Lokesh tweeted ridiculing the attack and indicating it as self-inflicted.\nTD’s state unit president K. Atchannaidu dismissed the attack on Jagan Mohan Reddy as a “poll stunt scripted by Jagan Mohan Reddy and the senior police officials – DGP and Intelligence chief – fearing severe drubbing in polls.”\n“It is nothing but Kodi Katti 2.0,” he added.\nThe party’s official handle on X, the social media platform, also maintained that it was an orchestrated attack.\nTD now changed its tack and accused the YSRC of trying to implicate Bonda Uma in the case.\nUma, trying to put on a brave face, threatened to take action against the police officials trying to implicate him once the TD government is formed. Chandrababu Naidu and Pawan Kalyan, addressing public meetings on Wednesday, presented a similar narrative, that the police have been preparing the ground to implicate Uma.\nJana Sena’s official handle reposted a tweet of a follower, which inadvertently admitted that the attack was not orchestrated. It sought to project that Jagan Mohan Reddy tried to blame the Opposition for the attack, contrary to the fact that some disgruntled elements threw a stone on Jagan Mohan Reddy over the party’s failure to fulfil the promise of food and liquor to the road show participants.\n",

    "content": " Kakinada: The conviction and 18 months’ jail term in a case of tonsuring the heads of two Scheduled Caste youths, by a court to YSRC’s Mandapeta candidate Thota Trimurthulu, appears to have come as a blessing in disguise for him.\n \n This is expected to consolidate his caste-based vote bank in the constituency. \n Some Kapu leaders, said to be from the Jana Sena, met Trimurthulu on Wednesday and rendered their support to him in Mandapeta. Curiously, there is no visible anger against Trimurhtulu from Scheduled Caste communities too despite his heinous act. \n After getting bail from a higher court on Tuesday, Trimurthulu came to Mandapeta at night through Dwarapudi, Ragampeta and Tapeswaram. Some inhabitants of SC colonies had been waiting to “welcome” him. But it was too late, so they reached the Mandapeta YSRC office on Wednesday to garland him. \n The YSRC cadres including SCs and Kapus welcomed Trimurthulu and took him on their shoulders to the office by showering flowers on him. The villages like Pedakorumilli, China Korumilli, Yedida, Kesavaram etc are strongholds of the Kapu community and by extension to the Jana Sena.  \n Notably, Trimurthulu had convened meetings with them previously by making use of his Kapu card and tried to lure them. Some of the JS cadres now joined hands with Trimurthulu. At the same time, Trimurthulu also managed to get support from the SCs in the constituency as he, as MLC, worked for their welfare in the past two years. \n “The Mala community, a section of Madigas and a majority of the BCs are in favour of Trimurthulu due to the help he provided to them in the past,’’ a SC community leader said.  \n He said that the tonsuring incident took place 28 years ago. “It raised strong opposition to Trimurthulu from the Dalits. They organised many protests against him. But the present generation of Dalits, mainly the youths, do not nurse any grudge against Trimurthulu now,’’ he claimed. \n Kapu Nadu chief adviser DN Ramesh said the SC atrocities case against Trimurthulu had not had any impact on Trimurthulu’s chances of victory in successive polls. “It need not be raised as an issue anymore also as the SC community is happy with the welfare schemes of the YSRC government. Trimurthulu, on his part, is also working in favour of SCs and BCs in Mandapeta constituency for the past two years.” \n The majority of the Kapus, including youths, want to support Trimurthulu in this election despite party flags, he claimed. \n Meanwhile, Telugu Desam leader S Rajesh demanded that the YSRC cancel the MLC post of Thota Trimurthulu and Ananta Udaya Bhaskar.  \n He told the media at Kakinada that Trimurthulu has been punished by the court for his crime against Dalits and Ananta Babu had killed a Dalit youth, V Subrahmanyam, and delivered his body to his family members. \n “Under the circumstances, the YSRC should cancel the candidature of Trimurthulu in Mandapeta constituency,” he said. \n \n",

    "content": "  \n The fascinating thing about the emerging situation in the Middle East is that there are a large number of diverse opinions on the progression of the various conflicts. Their complexities make any assessment a serious challenge. While the Arab (Palestinian)-Israeli conflict is well understood, not too many analysts have bothered to clarify the backdrop to the Iran-Israel enmity and the strategies that both have adopted over the years to neutralise each other. Since the two nations do not have a common border, the nature of the standoff is also quite different to what is commonly understood about conflicts. The normal perception about war and conflict is about land and borders in contention. That is not true here, and it’s important to understand that. Iran’s intent, ever since the Islamic revolution in 1979, has focused on espousing the Palestinian cause. It feels that the Arabs have done little and virtually supplicated to Israel due to repeated military defeats which they suffered at its hands, and to enable the feathering of their nests while they enjoy the hydrocarbon boom. Iran chose to fight Israel differently -- by proxy without direct use of its own human resources. Three areas with specific proxies were chosen for this. The first is the Syria-Lebanon area, with a border with Israel: Hezbollah and the Syrian Army have acted as proxies here against Israeli interests. The second is the Gaza Strip, where Iran supports Hamas and its various activities to keep Israel unsettled. The third is a comparatively faraway location -- South Yemen -- where the Houthi militias fight Iran’s nemesis Saudi Arabia, but are ever ready to join any conflict to harm Israeli interests. In recent months, the Houthis have made efforts to deny Israel its energy supply which comes through the Gulf of Aden-Red Sea route. It has even fired missiles at the southern Israeli port of Eilat. While Iran has a large military of almost 550,000, it also has the supplementary strength of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) -- around 150,000 -- which is responsible for Iran’s trans-national regional interests. Within that is the Quds Force, that conducts intelligence and covert operations and is thus largely involved with the proxies that it controls. Iran has deliberately raised and organised a large missile and rocket force over the last 35 years, taking assistance from North Korea, China and Russia; these vary in quality from the rustic, crude and obsolete to modern ones. A large number of these rocket and missile resources are deployed in Syria, Lebanon and some even in the Gaza Strip, from where Israel has often been targeted. Iran has in recent years chosen to indigenously manufacture armed drones and add them to the capability of the proxy forces which operate these resources. \n The question put to me very often in the past few days is why Israel keeps targeting the various bases, resources and human elements in the Levant (Lebanon, Syria and Northern Iraq). It last hit the Iranian consulate in Damascus by an airstrike on April 1, which became the trigger for the current exchanges. Actually, Israel perceives that if the IRGC and Quds Force elements are allowed to settle in this region and stabilise themselves with effective networks, Israel would be inviting a major problem for itself. It would be a virtual extension of Iran in close proximity to the Israeli border, thus enhancing the scope of the Iranian proxy offensive activity. Hence the concentrated Israeli focus on intelligence acquisition and directing of strikes against high-profile targets. For Iran it becomes a compulsion to respond if it is struck because of the muscular approach that it has adopted all these years, as against the benign Arab strategy of ignoring the Palestinian cause in favour of an arrangement such as the Abraham Accords. The Iranian response can be tempered in different ways and not just remain a tit-for-tat one. However, in the context of the war in Gaza, Iran would like to keep Israel’s northern front unpredictably active. The reasons are simple: divert attention from the south and force Israel to keep the full strength of its mobilisation active. The latter is an expensive proposition for Israel and creates problems in its relationship with the United States. \n In the present case, where Iran decided to respond in a calibrated way with the 300-odd rockets, missiles and drones, many perceive that Israel’s ability to intercept 99 per cent of these was a major victory. In this kind of warfare, defining victory is itself a challenge. Air or missile strikes and responses are not designed for quick fix solutions involving military victory. A school of thought ascribes the Israeli success to the deliberate strategy followed by Iran in using slow flying drones to alert Israeli forces, followed by low profile missiles to draw fire of the sophisticated Iron Dome systems, leading to the high percentage of interceptions. Iran’s strategy was to apparently demonstrate capability and resolve, just as it did against the US airbase that it struck in January 2020. A response of convenience designed to give scope for rhetoric without actually achieving effect through inflicted casualties appears to have been the Iranian strategy. \n Media reports talk of the Israelis having junked US advice not to retaliate and will respond in due course, in intensity and a time of its choosing. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would be putting Israel to greater risk if this retaliation leads to escalation across Lebanon, Syria and northern Iraq. Its northern border is not a situation of comfort in Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. For the US, a continued escalation adversely affects the Democrats’ aspirations in the presidential race. If Mr Netanyahu listens to some hawkish elements in the IDF, he could agree to target Iran’s nuclear assets under development. This, however, may not be achievable without US assistance, and the US is likely to hold back on this. \n If the escalation comes or does not in the form of an Israeli response to the multiple missiles targeting its territory, the impact of the recent events will not be helpful towards bringing about a ceasefire in Gaza. It has intensified tensions. It will, however, be beneficial to Mr Netanyahu in terms of elongating his political life. However, the longer his presence persists and operations in Gaza are conducted without thought to the human aspects, the sympathy factor for Israel is only likely to dwindle. Israel purportedly believes in proactiveness. If it could proactively lower the intensity of its operation in Gaza in favour of a humanitarian break and ceasefire, it is likely to benefit far more. \n",

He was driven by a burning desire to prove his detractors wrong after facing humiliation during his stint in the police force. \n Recounting his ordeal, Reddy revealed that in 2018, while serving as a constable with the AP Police, he was publicly insulted by a Circle Inspector in front of about 60 cops. Deeply hurt by the incident, Reddy decided to resign his job the same day, vowing to chart a new course for himself. \n \"Even though it was not my fault, the CI insulted me in front of others out of personal grudge. I resigned from the job. I took a vow to become an IAS officer. From that year, I started preparing. In my fourth attempt, I secured the 780th rank,\" Reddy said. \n A native of Oollapalem village in Singarayakonda Mandal, Reddy lost his parents at a young age and was raised by his grandmother, Ramanamma.  \n Despite facing numerous challenges, he persevered and managed to secure a job as a constable, serving in Gudluru between 2013 and 2018. However, the humiliating incident proved to be a pivotal moment, fuelling his ambition to join the Civil Service. \n   \n Although Reddy may initially be assigned to the Indian Revenue Service, he remains undeterred and plans to continue his studies until he qualifies for the IAS. Driven by a deep compassion for animals, he hopes to establish the 109 services across the country dedicated to their welfare.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n\n",

Lord Ram killed Ravanasura to usher in ‘Rama Rajyam’. Similarly, I urge the people of AP to defeat the YSRC and its leader Jagan Mohan Reddy so as to help the 3-party alliance to form the next government and establish ‘Rama Rajyam’.”\n Naidu said the BJP-led NDA government with nearly 400 LS seats was all set to form government in Delhi for the third successive term. “It would be easy for AP to approach the Centre and get funds for taking up development works and to implement welfare schemes if the 3-party alliance forms the next government here.”\n “If the YSRC is re-elected to power, it might not be able to get funds from the Centre with the ease with which we can get it,” he claimed.\n Referring to the findings of 11 survey reports which stated that the 3-party alliance would win 17 to 23 Lok Sabha seats in AP, Naidu sounded confident of winning 160 Assembly and 25 LS seats.\n The TD chief alleged that Jagan Mohan Reddy was playing dramas of ‘Kodi Kathi’ and stone pelting and even conspired to implicate the alliance leaders. “The YSRC leaders promised to offer `500, a quarter bottle of liquor and a biryani packet per head if the youngsters stand on the road and welcome Jagan Mohan Reddy during his bus yatra. As they failed to give these to the youths, somebody might have pelted a stone out of anger,” Naidu reasoned.\n He asked as to why Jagan Mohan Reddy failed to respond “when I was attacked with stones at my Undavalli residence earlier,” even as the alliance leaders condemned the stone attack on Jagan Mohan Reddy.\n He lashed out at Jagan Mohan Reddy for trying to generate sympathy on the pretext of death of his father and former CM, late Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, in the 2014 polls, “murder of his uncle in 2019, and coming up with dead bodies of pensioners in the 2024 polls.”\n Naidu said 20-30 MLAs and some MPs left Jagan Mohan Reddy’s party.\n He called upon the chairpersons of Zilla Parishads, Mandal Parishad presidents, ZPTCs, MPTCs, gram sarpanches to join the alliance.\n He announced several sops including two cents of land to the landless and financial assistance to construct pucca houses and to restore TIDCO houses.\n Blaming Pedana MLA and minister Jogi Ramesh was involved in graft, he said and cautioned him to keep his mouth under control. He also gave a call to uproot YSRC from power and drown it in Bay of Bengal.\n Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan, referring to the remarks of Jagan Mohan Reddy on himself leaving the Bhimavaram Assembly segment to contest elsewhere, asked the CM: “Why are you feeling more pain about me when you changed candidates for 70 Assembly segments?”\n He called upon the people to support the alliance to win the polls, and took potshots at Pedana MLA and minister Jogi Ramesh for his alleged involvement in high-level corruption. He promised to extend all support to several sections of the people in Pedana segment, be it Kalamkari workers, fishermen, youth or others and vowed to resolve the fluoride issue.\n\n",

His supporters owing allegiance to NDCCB (Nellore District Cooperative Central Bank) chairman Kamireddy Satyanarayana Reddy allegedly tried to attack Kalathuru Sekhar Reddy, YSRC Sullurpet town president, who belongs to the faction opposing Satyanarayana Reddy.\nBut for police intervening in a timely manner, the situation would have turned violent, as supporters of Sekhar Reddy were there in good numbers. Groups belonging to Sullurpet municipal chairman Dabbala Sreemanth Reddy and party leader Kalathuru Sunil Reddy have rallied in favour of Sekhar Reddy.\nThe lit fuse got put off after MLA Sanjeevaiah, MPP Alluri Anil Reddy, and other senior leaders intervened, pacified Sekhar Reddy and his supporters, and sent them away from the scene.\nHowever, Sekhar Reddy has gone on to lodge a complaint with area police sub-inspector Rahim Reddy, alleging a threat to his life from his rivals.\nAnimosity between Satyanarayana and Sekhar Reddy factions has been simmering for some time now, with both lodging police complaints against each other. Sekhar Reddy has accused the NDCCB chairman of harbouring a grudge against him after he questioned the latter’s involvement in the illegal transportation of gravel and sand.\n\"Satyanarayana Reddy tried to get his men to attack me during the campaign. He keeps threatening to kill me with his gunmen,\" Sekhar Reddy told media.\nThe YSRC Sullurpet town president says he has informed the MLA about the threat from Satyanarayana Reddy, apart from bringing the issue to the notice of the high command through Minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy.\nSignificantly, YSRC leadership has already cautioned both groups against the ill effects of infighting during the elections. But the advice appears to have fallen on deaf ears so far.\nSekhar Reddy has demanded that action be taken against those who tried to assault him.",

    "content": " Raipur: A day after 29 Maoists including two Naxal commanders were gunned down in an encounter with security forces in a forest in Kanker district under Bastar in Chhattisgarh, a video of the incident on Wednesday surfaced.\n \n The 7.08-minute-long video clip has captured the jawans advancing towards the Maoists’ camp in Hapatola jungle under Chhotebetiya police station while exchanging fire with the Naxals. \n The jawans were seen taking cover behind the trees in the jungle from time to time not to get hit by bullets fired by Maoists before scaling a small mound where the Naxals had taken position. \n “Don’t advance hurriedly....take cover behind the trees.....the forces in the back must not fire... don’t get too close (to Maoists”), a voice in the purported video was heard saying. \n The encounter site resembled a war field with bullets seen flying and hitting the trees. \n Sources disclosed to this newspaper that one of the jawans who took part in the search operation in Hapatola jungle may have taken the video and circulated it in social media network sites. \n “We are verifying the authenticity of the video. But, the area captured in the video resembles the encounter site”, a senior police officer of Bastar told this newspaper, unwilling to be quoted. \n Sources said that acting on specific intelligence inputs that around 40-50 Maoists lead by the commander of North Bastar Division of Maoists Shankar Rao had been camping in Hapatola jungle, a joint party comprising personnel of Border Security Force (BSF) and District Reserve Guard (DRG) launched a search operation in the area. \n The Naxls had barely finished their lunch when security forces surrounded them and appealed to them to surrender.  \n However, the Maoists opened fire on the security personnel, leading to a fierce gun battle between them in which 29 rebels were killed and three jawans, including a Border Security Force (BSF) inspector, injured. \n As many as 22 weapons including five Ak 47 assault rifles, INSAS and Self-Loading Rifles and huge quantities of explosives were recovered at the encounter site, police said. \n It was the biggest ever casualty suffered by Maoists in Bastar in one encounter , so far. \n Tuesday’s counterinsurgency operation in Hapatola jungle is viewed in the security circles as significant since it had taken place at the strategic place, a tri-junction of Narayanpur and Kanker districts under Bastar in Chhattisgarh and Gadchiroli in Maharashtra. \n “Security forces have for the first time breached Abujhmad, a 4,000 sq km area extending from Bastar in Chhattisgarh to Gadchiroli in Maharashtra '', a senior police officer of Bastar said. \n Abujhmad, the only patch in the country that has remained un-surveyed till date, is also considered a safe haven for Maoists.\n\n",

    "content": " VIJAYAWADA: Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has intensified his election campaign after the stone attack incident, with roadshows and public meetings from Thursday.\n\n Jagan Mohan Reddy has increased his pitch by intensifying the election campaign of the YSRC by attracting more crowds to his Memantha Siddham Bus Yatra roadshows and public meetings, which is claimed to be an added advantage to YSRC and its candidates.\n The Chief Minister took a break from the Memantha Siddham Bus Yatra on Wednesday on the occasion of Sri Rama Navami festival, stayed in the Tetali night stay camp, reviewing the party campaigns. He would resume the roadshows and public meetings on Thursday.\n Jagan Mohan Reddy did a review and analysis of the fulfilment of promises by the Telugu Desam and Jana Sena and explained his government's welfare and development initiatives for the past five years. He said these won accolades even in Krishna Delta and Godavari regions that had been seen as bastions to the Opposition.\n For instance, Vijayawada Central and East constituencies were strong bastions to TD. But, YSRC nominee Malladi Vishnu won the Central seat in the 2019 elections with a majority of only 25 votes, showing the stronghold of TD in Vijayawada city. But with the entry of Jagan Mohan Reddy, the scenario changed.\n People in large numbers joined the Bus Yatra of the CM, which passed through the middle of the city and it also led to the stone attack, on Saturday last.\n Jagan Mohan Reddy took a day’s break after the stone attack and resumed the yatra by increasing his verbal attacks on Naidu and Pawan Kalyan, through ‘dynamite dialogues’ and by undertaking a public auditing of the Chandrababu government’s performance in his last term.\n Changing his speech dynamics, Jagan Mohan Reddy said, “Chandrababu gets high BP if we question his achievements or about the schemes he implemented during his term. He asked, “Did Naidu bring Microsoft or host the Olympics in AP as he had promised in 2014?”\n He came down heavily on the JS chief Pawan Kalyan, highlighting the “changing of wives and constituencies like cars”, which turned viral.\n Political analysts say the YSRC had a strong base in the Rayalaseema, Prakasam and Palnadu regions which helped in the success of the bus yatra but they expected a thinning of the crowds in Guntur, Krishna and coastal districts due to the huge support the TD, Jana Sena and BJP enjoyed there, but in vain.”\n “Traditionally TD holds a strong base in Guntur, Vijayawada, Krishna and NTR districts but huge turnouts were evident at Jagan Mohan Reddy’s road shows and public meetings in these regions, which worried the Opposition parties,” they said.\n They also noted that the CM changed his speech pattern by trashing the claims of Naidu, and “this is forcing the masses, mainly the youngsters to do fact checks about Chandrababu’s claims of bringing IT, cellphones, building Hyderabad and Cyberabad, Amaravati, Smart cities etc to AP.”\n They stated that Jagan Mohan Reddy brought about development for Krishna Delta and the coastal regions, which would be an added advantage to the YSRC candidates.\n\n",

Officials of the state branch of Election Commission of India (ECI) said that the star campaigners and other leaders of any political parties would not be allowed to stay in five constituencies after the campaign deadline is over.\nAll five seats of Maharashtra will be going for polls on Friday in the first phase of elections. The poll campaign at the Gadchiroli -Chimur constituency in Gadchiroli district, which is one of the 12 Naxal affected districts in the country, ended at 3 pm on Wednesday.

All political functionaries, who are not voters in these constituencies, should leave. Election machinery is ready with all the preparations to enable voters to cast their vote. It is time for the voters to elect their representatives.”\nOn the last day of campaigning in Ramtek, chief minister Eknath Shinde held a roadshow in scorching heat for his party candidate Raju Parwe.

However, their sales tripled from the average outtake on Tuesday with the shopkeepers making arrangements for the quick dispensation of the bottle. The tripling of sales was not just due to political party functionaries stacking up liquor for distribution on polling day but also due to black marketers seeing a potential to make quick money during the next three days that had been declared as dry days.\nThe top candidates fielded by the three major political coalitions for the three constituencies in Chennai began their campaign quite early in the day on Wednesday and went around the localities that they might have missed in the last three weeks, lending a carnival aura till the deadline of 6 pm.\nOne of the major issues that candidates broached with the voters was floods. Tamilisai Soundarajan, the BJP candidate for South Chennai told the people that if she was elected, she would ensure zero flooding of the constituency as she had identified 25 lakes that would be desilted to create space for the rain water to flow in.\nHer DMK rival Tamilachi Thangapandian attended the Besant Nagar meeting addressed by Stalin after concluding her house visits a bit earlier in the day. So did Dayanidhi Maran fighting it out from Central Chennai after hectic campaigning since the beginning of season.\nMaran’s rival from the AIADMK camp, B Parthasarathy of the DMDK, too went around the constituency seeking votes by introducing him as a ‘ordinary man.’ Vinoj P Selvam, fielded by the BJP from Central Chennai, too, was in the field wooing the voters with promises of bringing in a change.\nR C Paul Kanagaraj, BJP nominee from North Chennai, introduced himself as the ‘son of the soil’ who would be at the beck and call of every voter. Since he resides within the constituency jurisdiction, the people could access him easily for any help. Many traders’ bodies in North Chennai had reportedly pledged their support to him.\nAIADMK candidate from North Chennai, Royapuram Mano, is also a local leader with enormous clout among the people of the region. He too was on his toes on the last day, garnering support from all sorts of people.\nThe AIADMK candidates, including Jayavaradhan from South Chennai, had been saying that during AIADMK rule, Palaniswami had distributed flood relief to the victims generously and that there were plans to start smart city projects that would have prevented flooding.\nThe BJP candidates’ allegation was that the DMK government did not spend the Rs 4000 crore released by the Union Government to take up measures to prevent flooding.\nNTK’s Seeman was in suburban regions likes Korattur and Ambattur telling them people to give his party a chance since the DMK and AIADMK had failed to discharge their duties, during their respective tenures, properly.",

While Congress candidate P Ravi won the seat in 2009, YSRC candidates Sunil Kumar and MS Babu secured back-to-back victories in 2014 and 2019 respectively. After three consecutive defeats, the TD now replaced its former candidate Lalitha Kumari, who lost in 2009, 2014 and 2019, with K Murali Mohan, a senior journalist.\nThe YSRC has fielded its former MLA, M. Sunil Kumar, who aims to reclaim the seat he held from 2014 to 2019.\nThe TD is pinning its hopes on Murali Mohan to break the party's electoral drought in the constituency since its delimitation in 2008.\nAdding a twist to the contest, the Congress has nominated M.S. Babu, the incumbent YSRC MLA who defected to the party recently after he was denied ticket by the ruling party.\nWhile Murali Mohan aims to appeal to the constituency's electorate with his own development manifesto and the TD’s Super Six agenda, Sunil hopes to leverage his experience and the YSRC government’s welfare schemes to win votes.\nBoth Sunil and Murali are actively engaged in the campaign.\nHowever, the entry of Babu as the Congress candidate has added an intriguing twist to the electoral battle. His vocal criticism of the YSRC leadership, particularly chief minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, and his allegations of unfair treatment towards SC MLAs have garnered him sympathy from certain sections of the voters.\nPolitical analysts believe Babu's defection from the YSRC and entry to the Congress at this time could lead to a sharp vote-splitting, especially among the Dalit and Tamil Mala communities that are linked to him, much to the disadvantage of the YSRC nominee.\nBabu's influence extends beyond party lines. His affiliation with the Tamil Mala community, combined with the presence of the sizable Tamil population among Dalits in the area might be an advantage to the Congress in the constituency.\n\n",

In a show of strength, top MVA leaders including Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar will attend a meeting before the three candidates, including Supriya Sule file their nominations. The alliance will also hold a roadshow in the city.\n\n While Ms. Sule will file her nomination for the keenly watched Baramati seat, another NCP MP Amol Kolhe will file nomination for the Shirur seat and Congress’s Ravindra Dhangekar will file nomination for the Pune seat. \n According to reports, there will be a meeting of the MVA in front of Hotel Shantai at Rasta Peth in Pune. After the meeting, the three candidates will together proceed to file their nomination papers.\n Apart from Mr. Thackeray and Mr. Pawar, NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar) state president Jayant Patil, Shiv Sena UBT’s Sanjay Raut and Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat will also be present. \n The election to all the four constituencies in Pune district will be held in two phases and the Baramati Lok Sabha constituency will go to polls on May 7. Polling will be held in Pune, Shirur and Maval Lok Sabha constituencies on May 13.\n In Baramati, Ms. Sule’s main rival is her sister-in-law and Ajit Pawar’s wife Sunetra Pawar. She will also file her nomination on the same day. Mr. Kolhe is pitted against former Shiv Sena MP Shivajirao Adhalrao Patil, who is now contesting as the candidate of the Ajit Pawar faction. While in Maval, Shiv Sena’s Shrirang Barne is the sitting MP. He had defeated Ajit Pawar’s son Parth in 2019. This time, Shiv Sena UBT has fielded Sanjog Waghere against him.\n In Pune Lok Sabha constituency, the main contest is between Congress’s Mr. Dhangekar and Muralidhar Mohol from Mahayuti. However, Congress has a tough road ahead as Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi and AIMIM have also fielded their candidates. If the two parties manage to split Dalit and Muslim votes, it will hurt the chances of Mr. Dhangekar. In the 2019 elections which I contested, the VBA’s and the AIMIM’s candidates collectively polled only 65,000 votes.\n “We were mulling to contest six to eight seats in Maharashtra. But now we have decided to concentrate on four seats. Anees Sundke will be the AIMIM candidate from Pune,” AIMIM leader Imtiyaz Jaleel said.\n",

Revanth Reddy on Wednesday expressed confidence that the next prime minister will be Rahul Gandhi, MP from southern state of Kerala, after Lok Sabha elections. He said Narendra Modi, MP from Varanasi, served as the Prime Minister for 10 years and the next Prime Minister will be Rahul Gandhi from Wayanad for 20 years. \nRevanth Reddy reminded the voters of Wayanad, from where Rahul Gandhi is seeking reelection as an MP, that they are electing the PM and not just electing an MP. Once Rahul Gandhi becomes the Prime Minister, he said southern states, which were neglected by the Narendra Modi government, will benefit a lot with huge fund allocations.\nRevanth Reddy left for a two-day visit to Kerala on Wednesday to campaign for Rahul Gandhi and Congress-led UDF candidates in Kerala. His campaign evoked a huge response with a massive crowd turning up to greet him and gathering on the sides of the roads and nearby buildings. Revanth Reddy will campaign in a few more states in April and May.\nSpeaking to media persons at Wayanad, Revanth Reddy said, \"Rahul Gandhi is going to be the Prime Minister of this country. For the last 10 years, the Prime Minister has been from Varanasi, and for the coming 20 years, the Prime Minister will be from Wayanad.\"\nReferring to the BJP's \"400-plus\" slogan, he said, \"It will only remain as a slogan but it won't succeed as Modi has got two terms but he has betrayed people.\"\nAlleging that South India faced 'discrimination' during the past 10-year rule of the Modi government, Revanth Reddy said, \"South India is also in India. Why didn't Modi come here earlier? Why didn't he give us the bullet train and riverfront like Sabarmati? Modi remembers South India only for votes. He hasn't given political representation to South India in big positions such as President of India, Vice-President, home minister, defence minister, etc. Financial allocations to South India were less compared with North India. The BJP has no right to seek votes in South India. The South has banned them.\"\nAccusing the BJP of indulging in 'legal corruption'. Revanth Reddy said all those who are indulging in corruption including Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan are working with Modi. “Why is the Kerala CM not supporting the LDF candidate in Wayanad? He is supporting BJP candidate Surendran.\"\nThe Chief Minister said that the BJP's claims of '400 paar' were creating doubts among people on EVMs. \"Everyone has the same doubt. Even when the BJP MPs meet us in the Central Hall of Parliament, they say that until Modi and EVM are together, you (Congress) won't come to power. What relation does Modi have with EVM? Is EVM Modi's younger brother? Why do the BJP and Modi fear having elections through the ballot paper?\"\nStating that elections around the world were being conducted through ballot paper, Revanth Reddy said, “Only India is using EVMs. We, the people, have lost faith in EVM. Only the BJP has faith in EVM, but that's not enough.\"",

Taking the attack on the BJP, Rahul Gandhi claimed on Wednesday that there was a strong undercurrent in favour of the Opposition INDIA bloc in the Lok Sabha elections and that the BJP will be limited to 150 seats. “15-20 days ago I was thinking the BJP would win around 180 seats, but now I think they will get 150 seats. We are getting reports from every state that we are improving,” he said. \nHe maintained suspense over his contesting from Amethi in Uttar Pradesh and was non-committal when asked who the party would field against the BJP’s Smriti Irani. “This is BJP’s question, very good. Whatever order I will get, I will follow it. In our party, all these (selection of candidates) decisions are taken by the Congress Election Committee,” Mr Gandhi said when asked who the Congress will field from Amethi. He said that he was a “soldier of the party” and will abide by whatever decision the committee takes.\nAttacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Rahul claimed the electoral bonds scheme was the “biggest extortion scheme”. He said: “A few days ago, the Prime Minister gave a very long interview to ANI. It was scripted, but it was a flop show. The Prime Minister tried to explain electoral bonds in it. The Prime Minister said that the system of electoral bonds was brought for transparency, and to clean politics. If this is true, then why was that system cancelled by the Supreme Court? And second, if you wanted to bring transparency, why did you hide the names of those who gave money to the BJP? And why did you hide the dates on which they gave you the money?”\nOn the possibility of a joint manifesto of the INDIA alliance, Akhilesh Yadav said that the Congress manifesto has several measures to eradicate poverty. “All INDIA alliance partners are promising a guarantee of MSP. Poverty will start getting eradicated when the Government of India will increase the income of farmers.” Akhilesh said the alliance will fight for a caste census, social justice, and PDA, which will end poverty. Targeting the BJP over the electoral bonds scheme, Mr Yadav said the electoral bonds have exposed the BJP and the BJP has become a godown of all corrupt people. He further added: “PDA (pichhda, dalit, and alpsankhyak) will defeat the NDA (National Democratic Alliance)”. The SP chief went on to say that the INDIA alliance will “defeat the BJP from Ghaziabad to Ghazipur”.

    "content": " Congress and BJP logoCongress and BJP logoMangaluru: As the political arena heats up with the forthcoming Parliament election, all eyes are on the Congress and BJP, each vying for supremacy. While BJP claims to sweep all 28 seats, the Congress is aiming to grab at least 20 seats. An interesting question looms large in the minds of both the voters and party workers alike: will the 135 seats held by Congress in the 228-member Karnataka assembly help its prospects in the upcoming election?\nBoth camps present convincing arguments. While Congress says that its sizable assembly presence will surely sway the tide in its favor, BJP counters by pointing to historical data where despite reigning in the state, Congress failed to beat the BJP in the parliament election. \nIn Karnataka politics, the statistics speak volumes. Over the past four elections, Congress has failed to break into double digits in the state. BJP leaders argue that past elections have shown a divergence in voting patterns between assembly and parliamentary contests. For instance, despite Congress holding 122 seats in the 2013 assembly elections, the following parliamentary election (in 2014) saw the BJP clinch 17 seats compared to the Congress party's 9. A similar trend continued in 2019, with BJP sweeping 25 seats while Congress and JD(S) managed only one each, even when the latter coalition held power in the state assembly.\nDespite these trends, Karnataka's electoral history reveals interesting facts. There are instances where the party with a stronger assembly presence also reaped greater parliamentary rewards. \nIn 1999, Congress, led by SM Krishna, formed the state government and secured 18 out of 28 parliamentary seats, overshadowing BJP's tally of 7. In the 1994 assembly elections, Janata Dal, led by HD Devegowda, won 115 seats and formed the state government, and in the parliament election held two years later (1996), the party achieved a record by winning 16 seats. Under the banner of the United Front, Gowda became the Prime Minister of India. \nSimilarly, in 1989, Congress almost swept the assembly polls with 178 seats. In the same year's parliamentary election, the party won 27 out of 28 seats, with the remaining one going to Janata Dal. Congress maintained its strength in the 1991 parliamentary election, securing 23 seats. \nHowever, in the 1984 parliamentary election, despite the Janata Party being in power in the state, Congress won 24 seats. \nThese instances show that sometimes the party in power in the state wins more seats, while at other times, it doesn't.\nThe correlation between state and parliamentary outcomes, however, is not always straightforward. Strong electoral waves have often defied conventional expectations. \nThe 1985 elections saw Congress, under Rajiv Gandhi, outperformed the incumbent Janata Party government, buoyed by the wave following Indira Gandhi's demise. Meanwhile, the Vajpayee wave bolstered the BJP's fortunes in 1998, despite the Janata Dal holding power in Karnataka. Yet, in 1999, SM Krishna's leadership propelled Congress to victory in both assembly and parliamentary arenas, surpassing BJP's parliamentary tally.\nDespite Congress's hold on the state in 2014 and the Congress-JD(S) coalition in 2019, BJP capitalized on the Modi wave to secure more seats in Karnataka.\nWith Congress setting its sights on winning 20 parliamentary seats in Karnataka, the party faces the daunting task of highlighting BJP's shortcomings while showcasing its achievements to counter the Modi wave. While Congress leaders are confident that all its MLAs are toiling by reaching out to the people, especially the success of guarantee schemes, the BJP is banking on Modi's accomplishments and Congress's failures to bolster its electoral prospects.\nAs the political landscape evolves, the ultimate verdict will rest on whether the voters bend towards the Modi wave or sway towards a Congress resurgence in Karnataka.",

The ruling YSRC, which took the lead in promoting and encouraging women in politics, offered women as many as 24 seats for contest this time. The 3-party alliance of TD, BJP and Jana Sena offered women 18 constituencies.\nMinister RK Roja, an actress-turned politician, leads the YSRC pack. Some 19 YSRC women are contesting for the assembly and five for the Lok Sabha. Botsa Jhansi Lakshmi, Cheti Tanuja Rani, Guduri Uma Bala, Joladarasi Santha are named for the LS fray.\nReddy Shaanti, Piriya Vijaya, Nagulapalli Dhanalakshmi, Pamula Pushpasreevani, Viswasarayi Kalavathi, Vanga Geetha, Taneti Vanita, Tellam Rajyalakshmi, Mekathoti Sucharitha, Vidala Rajini, Murugudu Lavanya, Shaik Noori Fatima, Kalathur Krupalakshmi, RK Roja, Dasari Sudha, Butta Renuka, Kanagati Sreedevi, and KV Ushashri Charan are being fielded for the assembly seats.\nThe TD-Jana Sena-BJP alliance has fielded 18 women candidates. They are Kothapalli Geeta, Dagupati Purandeswari, Joyakka Jagadeshwari, Gummadi Sandhya Rani, Vangalapudi Anita, Yanamala Divya, Tangirala Sowmya, Nelavela Vijaysree, Akhila Priya Reddy, Bandaru Sravani Sree, and Sunitha, Lokam Madhavi Reddy, Bhuma Akhila Priya Reddy, Gouru Chartiha Reddy, Savitha, Kurugondala Lakshmi Priya, Geetha Jayasuriya, Sindhura Reddy and Yashoda Devi.\nIn the 2019 elections, 15 women from the TD, 12 from the YSRC and 8 from Jana Sena were in the fray. Out of these, YSRC's Nagulapalli Dhanalakshmi, Taneti Vanita, Vidala Rajini, Vundavall Sridevi, R K Roja, Pamula Pushpa Sreevani, Jonnalagadda Padmavathy, Sucharitha Mekathoti, K Sreedevi and Otaggulli Bhagya Lakshmi from the YSRC won the polls.\nFrom the TD, M Suguna and Adireddy Bhavani won their seats.\nHowever, the number of women MLAs has decreased in recent years. The rate of victory for women in the 2019 elections was 6 per cent, down from 10 per cent in 2014.\nNotably, the ruling YSRC has not fielded a single woman candidate in Nellore district for the assembly elections this time. The Telugu Desam gave tickets to three women in the district.\nTD candidates Vemireddy Prashanthi Reddy (Kovur), Kurukondla Lakshmi Priya (Venkatagiri) and Nelavala Vijayasree (Sullurupeta) are new to electoral politics, but are hailing from families with a political legacy. Prashanthi Reddy is a homemaker, Lakshmi Priya an entrepreneur and Vijayasree a medical professional.\nDespite the increased representation, the fall in ratio of women winning elections remains a concern. The 2024 elections will be a test of whether this trend will change or not.",

    "content": " Bengaluru: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday stated that he favours holding Caste census and financial survey of families across the country so that dalits, tribals, backward class and poor general caste people know the status of each communities and termed the holding of caste census in the country, idf voted to power, would be “a revolutionary step.” \n\n In his election campaign at Kolar taluk, Rahul Gandhi stated “We are going to do x-ray of India and place its report before the people of the country.” He wanted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to speak on caste census whether he is in favour or against it and stated that “Whenever I speak on caste census Modi goes silent.” \n Rahul said that the only way to give rights to the poor general caste, dalits, tribals and backward is through holding caste census and asserted that “We are committed to it.” \n He accused Modi of meting out ‘unfairness’ to the people of the country and pointed out that Rs 16 lakh crore loans of 22 rich and businessmen have been waived off and spoke nothing when farmers asked for farm loan waiver. \n “The 22 businessmen (favoured by Modi) have access to all,” alleged Rahul Gandhi and stated that the loans waived by Modi for 22 businessmen could have run Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme for 24 years. \n “What have you done for 22 businessmen is an insult to farmers of the country?” charged Rahul and termed non-waiver off farm loans as “a crime against every farming family.”  \n According to the Congress leader, the amount owned by 22 businessmen of the country is same as the amount owned by the 70 crore population of the country put together and alleged that 22 businessmen favoured by Prime Minister Narendra Modi have “unlimited resources” and can afford to live their dream lives but others have to simply watch.  \n “I’m not saying businessmen should not be supported (by the Government). They should be supported for they are who create job opportunities but labourters, youth, farmers among others also strive to build the nation,” stated Rahul.  \n Accusing Narendra Modi of undue favours to businessman Gautam Adani, Rahul Gandhi said “If Adani wants a particular land, then, Modi gets him that land.” For instance, he alleged that the Mumbai airport owner got a case booked against him by the sleuths of Central Bureau of Investigation and later Mumbai airport was taken over by Adani. Adani wishes for cold storage facilities and he gets it. \n  \n Flaying Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Rahul said, “Modi has destroyed the employment system in the country” and stated that son of businessman (Gautham) Adani can get a job anywhere he likes but an unemployed youth has no job avenues.  \n Rahul said “We cannot allow this type of unfairness happening in the country” and told Prime Minister Narendra Modi that Congress party will give Rs 1 lakh as financial assistance to poor women of the country. \n He asserted to implement 5-guarantee schemes in the country, if Congress is voted to power in the ensuing election. President of All India Congress Committee (AICC) Mallikarjun Kharge spoke. \n\n",

    "content": " Hyderabad: A 13-year-old Dalit student, studying Class 6, died, while 29 students fell sick due to food poisoning at Social Welfare Ashram School in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district.\nThe victim, Chinnalachi Prashanth, died while undergoing treatment in Rainbow Hospital, Banjara Hills at 9 pm on Tuesday, while 16 others were treated in separate hospitals and are stated to be out of danger, police said.\nThe victims showed symptoms of food poisoning on April 11 afternoon while having dinner together at their hostel mess, police sources said.\nOn April 13, I received a call from school class teacher P. Rajeshwari, who informed me that my son Prashanth along with others, was admitted to Bhongir area government hospital. We rushed there. My son was suffering from acute pain in the stomach, and he was vomiting with severe dysentery and high fever, the victim’s father Chinnalachi Mahesh said.\nThe other students were recovering but Prashanth’s health was deteriorating. As the doctors suggested we should immediately shift him to a better hospital, we rushed my son to Miracle Hospital in Boduppal, where his pulse rate went down. He was kept on a ventilator for two days but he showed no improvement. Later, on our MLC’s reference, we shifted him to Rainbow Hospital in Banjara Hills on Tuesday, the victim’s father said.\n“After examination, the doctors informed me that my son’s condition was serious. His brain is dead and he went into a coma. By night, they declared him dead,” Mahesh said.\nOn coming to know about my son, my wife Prajata twice fell unconscious and went into deep trauma, he said.\nThe Social Welfare Ashram School is located in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district. It has over 480 students studying from Class 5 to Class 9.\nAfter consuming the food on April 11, the affected students exhibited symptoms of food poisoning. The staff, however, did not disclose the issue to parents instead they shifted all the 30 students in rooms for two days and gave them self-medication. When their situation did not improve, they shifted them to an area government hospital and informed their parents, G Mallikarjuna, the victim's uncle, said.\nPrashanth’s father had to sell his wife’s gold to pay over Rs 3.80 lakh in hospital bills. The state government should give compensation to the poor family who lost their kin due to the negligence of the asharam management and stern action should be taken against them, Malikarjun said.\nIt is reported that on Tuesday another six students fell victim to food poisoning and are undergoing treatment in an area government hospital in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district.\nHowever, the school management said that they immediately shifted the students to an area government and suspect that the students may have consumed rotten Ugadi food stored in their lunch boxes, while parents attribute the illness to the poor quality and cleanliness of the meals provided at the school.\nMahesh, the only bread earner in the family works as a car driver in Borabanda. Prashanth was his second son, his elder daughter C. Siri (15), and youngest son C Teju (9), belonged to Jiblakpally village of Bodan Pochampally Mandal, Nalgonda district.\nThe police registered a case of death due to negligence under Section 304A of the Indian Penal Code and the case is being probed, said K Suresh Kumar, inspector of Bhongir town police station.\nThe victim’s body after the post-mortem has been handed over to the family for his last rites, which will be performed at their native place.\nThe other students who fell sick due to food poisoning are identified as S Ajay Kumar and C Rishit, N Srivastav, T. Karthik, A Ajay, Basantkumar, M. Yeswant, and P Jaswant. They are undergoing treatment at the Bhuvanagiri Area Hospital.\nKalyan Krishna was shifted to Miracle Hospital in Uppal and discharged on April 15, while S. Ajay Kumar and M. Yeswant were shifted from Bhuvanagiri Hospital to Osmania Hospital on April 15.",

The father-son duo stole a large amount of the government or public money.  (Image Source: facebook)Kurnool:�Domination by local leaders is causing inconvenience to candidates of both the YSRC and Telugu Desam in the reserved constituency of Nandikotkur in Nandyal district.\nIt has become a common practice for local leaders to exert influence on candidates and create troubles if they refuse to budge.\nDuring the last tenure, SAAP chairman Byreddy Siddartha Reddy of the YSRC held sway as legislator in both party activities and development matters. This resulted in disputes between retired IPS officer and MLA Thoguru Arthur and Siddartha Reddy, ultimately leading to Arthur's resignation from the party. Arthus is now the Congress candidate.\nFollowing the resignation of the sitting legislator, the YSRC announced the candidacy of Dr Sudhir Dara, a newcomer from Kadapa district. As Arthur had a strong cadre base in the constituency, the newcomer is facing difficulties in garnering support from the YSRC leaders and cadres.\nA similar situation prevails in the TD. The party nominated newcomer G. Jayasurya, said to be a follower of Mandra Sivananda Reddy, from the same constituency. Sivananda Reddy is a realtor who sought the MP seat from Nandyal, but TD preferred Byreddy Shabari as the alliance candidate, after she switched loyalty from the BJP.\nPreviously, she served as the district president of the BJP.\nWhen Telugu Desam senior leader and Hindupur legislator Nandamuri Balakrishna visited the constituency recently, flex boards were displayed without the photo and mention of the party's Lok Sabha candidate Shabari. This caused protests within the party. Some leaders boycotted Balakrishna's programmes.\nTD’s Nandikotkur candidate Jayasurya is said to have followed the directions of Mandra Sivananda and faced backlash from the party cadre. Leaders attributed this to the anti-party activities of Sivananda Reddy, who failed to secure the party's LS ticket from Nandyal.\nThe Nandikotkur reserved constituency comprises seven mandals, including Nandikotkur, Pagidyala, Jupadu Bungalow, Kothapalle, Pamulapadu and Midthur. It was a general assembly segment until 2009, when it became reserved.\nIn 2004, Gowru Charita Reddy from the Congress represented the constituency; and Byreddy Rajasekhar Reddy also served as a legislator from there after the 1994 and 1999 polls. Labbi Venkata Swamy from the Congress won the polls in 2009, followed by Isaiah Yekkaladevi from the YSRC in 2014, and retired police officer T. Arthur in 2019, both representing the YSRC.\nThis time, Dr Sudhir Dara is contesting from the ruling YSRC, Gitta Jayasurya from the opposition, and the recent legislator Arthur is representing the Congress.\nPolitical observers anticipate a triangular contest. Arthur is having wide contacts in the constituency while the other two parties strive to garner voter support.",

It further requested information on the effectiveness of these initiatives and any collaborative efforts with dental associations, NGOs, or international organisations to bolster oral health.\nHowever, the lack of a substantive response from both the ministry of health and family welfare and the Dental Council of India has exposed what dental students and surgeons in the state called a 'troubling gap' in transparency and accountability within India's healthcare governance.\nThis omission has sparked significant concern among dental professionals and students, who\nrely on this data to advocate for better public health policies. \nMohd Manzur, representing AIDSDSA, expressed his dismay at the government's inaction and said, \"The government's failure to respond to our RTI request denies us critical data needed to evaluate and improve the state of oral healthcare in India. This is not just an administrative oversight but a severe neglect of dental health, which is a vital component of public health.\"\nA dental student affiliated with the association shared her frustrations anonymously, highlighting the impact of this issue on future professionals. \"We are training to enter a field where our role is to advance public health. The government's indifference to such a critical aspect of healthcare reform is not only disappointing but also demoralising for all of us in the dental community,\" he told Deccan Chronicle. In light of these developments, AIDSDSA called on political parties in India to prioritise oral healthcare in their policy agendas and to take definitive steps to address the deficiencies laid bare by the government's non-disclosure.",

He also said that come what may, Palaniswami would never criticize the Governor R N Ravi or Union Home Minister Amit Shah or Narendra Modi as he did not have the courage or backbone to take on the BJP. \n\n",

    "content": " \n\n India's crude oil import dipped to 16 per cent in the fiscal year ended March 31 as lower international rates but the dependency on overseas suppliers rose to a new high. India imported 232.5 million tonnes of crude oil, which is refined into fuels like petrol and diesel, in the 2023-24 fiscal (April 2023 to March 2024), almost the same as in the previous financial year, according to data released by oil ministry’s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC).\n  \n India is estimated to be the world’s third largest oil importing and consuming nation, which has been able to add to its domestic production drop, raising its import dependence. As per the data, India paid $132.4 billion for the imports in FY24 as against $157.5 billion import bill in 2022-23.\n  \n “Import dependence of crude oil soared to 87.7 per cent in 2023-24, up from 87.4 per cent. However, the domestic crude oil production was almost unchanged at 29.4 million tonnes in 2023-24. Besides crude oil, India spent $23.4 billion on import of 48.1 million tonnes of petroleum products like LPG. It also exported 62.2 million tonnes of products for $47.4 billion,” the PPAC data showed.Other than oil, India also imports gas in its liquid form, called LNG. After the price shock of 2022-23, import of 30.91 billion cubic meters of gas cost $13.3 billion in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. This compared with $17.1 billion spent on import of 26.3 bcm of gas in 2022-23 when energy prices shot up to record levels in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n The data further showed that the net oil and gas import bill (crude oil plus petroleum product plus LNG import bill minus exports) stood at $121.6 billion in 2023-24, down from $144.2 billion. “Petroleum imports as percentage of India’s gross imports (in value terms) stood at 25.1 per cent, down from 28.2 per cent in 2022-23. Similarly, petroleum exports as a percentage of the country's gross exports came at 12 per cent in 2023-24 as compared to 14 per cent in the previous year,” the PPAC data showed.\n India’s fuel consumption also rose 4.6 per cent to a record 233.3 million tonnes in the year ended March 31, 2023. This compared with 223 million tonnes consumption in 2022-23 and 201.7 million tonnes in 2021-22. “While the country is short in crude oil production, it has surplus refining capacity, which enables export of petroleum products like diesel. Against the consumption of 233.3 million tonnes, petroleum product production was 276.1 million tonnes in 2023-24,” it showed.\n\n",

    "content": " IndiGoReach, the CSR arm of IndiGo, has been actively engaging in various heritage conservation initiatives across India, with a focus on preserving and promoting the country's rich cultural heritage. Through its partnerships with local communities, NGOs, and government agencies, IndiGoReach has been able to support a range of projects aimed at restoring historic monuments and cultural sites. These efforts have not only helped in preserving India's unique heritage for future generations but have also provided economic opportunities for local communities through tourism and other related activities. \n\n\n IndiGo's commitment to preserving and promoting India's rich cultural heritage is exemplified by its 'My City My Heritage' campaign. This initiative, in partnership with InterGlobe Foundation, has served as a platform for discussions and collaborations focused on preserving both the tangible and intangible heritage of the country. ‘My City My Heritage’ started in November 2022, and walks have since been conducted in Prayagraj, Bhubaneswar, Shillong, Nashik, with the latest one being in Hyderabad, in January 2024. These heritage walks have encouraged people to learn more about their city's history and heritage and take an active interest in its preservation.  \n The Heritage Walk in Hyderabad took place at the Qutb Shahi Complex.  \n The Qutb Shahi Tombs Complex comprises of mausoleums, mosques, five stepwells, a hammam (mortuary bath), pavilions, etc. built during the reign of the Qutb Shahi Dynasty. IndiGoReach supported the conservation of the Mausoleum of Muhammad Qutb Shah at the Qutb Shahi Heritage Park. While the programme under IndiGoReach has now concluded, InterGlobe Foundation will undertake the next phase of the conservation work in collaboration with Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC). The mausoleum is dedicated to Muhammad Qutb Shah, who pioneered the city of Hyderabad. He was the fifth Sultan of the Qutb Shahi Dynasty and was considered an able administrator. The mausoleum is one of the four most dominant structures in the Qutb Shahi Heritage Park. Through this preservation activity, IndiGoReach demonstrated the ecological impact of conservation using local materials and landscaping around the monument, which also resulted in reduction in carbon footprint.  \n Apart from the conservation of Muhammed Qutb Shah’s Mausoleum at the Qutb Shahi Heritage Park in Hyderabad, IndiGoReach has also undertaken projects for the restoration of the interiors of the Lal Bagh Palace in Indore, Madhya Pradesh and the Mausoleum of Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khana in New Delhi.  \n IndiGo's commitment to heritage conservation and fostering recognition of heritage sites is a testament to its dedication towards creating a sustainable and socially responsible business model. Its commitment to heritage conservation goes hand in hand with their efforts towards creating awareness about the importance of preserving our heritage and promoting responsible tourism. Their efforts are an inspiration to others in the industry and serve as a reminder of the importance of preserving our cultural heritage for future generations.\n\n",

Amit Mitra, main advisor to TMC supremo and chief minister Mamata Banerjee, and party Rajya Sabha MP Derek O'Brien made the promises public in English, Hindi, Bengali, Urdu, Nepali and Ol Chiki script at the party headquarters in Kolkata.\n\n One of the TMC's poll promises is the removal of the citizenship laws. It states under the \"Swaccho Ayin, Swadhin Bharat\" (Transparent Law, Independent India) title, “The botched up Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) will be abolished and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) will be discontinued. The Uniform Civil Code (UCC) will not be implemented in the country.”\n Ms Banerjee has vowed not to implement the CAA in West Bengal. In an appeal on the manifesto, she criticised the BJP government for attempting to undermine the Federal structure of the country.\n \"In the last 10 years, they have relentlessly undermined the tenets of federalism, pluralism, liberty, and democracy enshrined in the Constitution. Misusing Central agencies, they have tried to suppress the Opposition voices and target anyone who questions their anti-people policies,\" she wrote.\n The TMC also promises many welfare schemes if the INDIA bloc wins the ensuing Lok Sabha polls, including 100 days of guaranteed work with a hiked daily wage of `400, rations at the doorstep and 10 free cooking cylinders for the below-poverty-line families.\n The party also pledges that the number of higher education scholarships for OBCs, SC and STs will be increased to uplift youth from marginalised communities. The existing old age pension for elderly people over 60 years old will be hiked to `1,000 per month (`12,000 annually).”\n For the farmers, the Trinamul Congress, as per the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission, promises that the minimum support price (MSP) will be legally guaranteed to India’s farmers and set at least 50 per cent higher than the average cost of production of all crops.\n The party's manifesto also promises to bring a constitutional amendment to Article 155 to ensure that \"governors are appointed in consultation with state legislatures.\"\n \"The Federal rights of all states will be firmly preserved... We will not accept the 'One Nation, One Election' proposal,\" the party stated.\n The manifesto also mentions that the next round of India's decadal population census, which has not happened since 2011, will be conducted.\n The manifesto promises to ensure that the country's judiciary remains free from political pressures or inducements, advocating instead for a neutral, impartial, transparent commission.\n The TMC pledges to restore the autonomy of agencies such as the CBI, ED, NIA, and income-tax department, as well as bodies like the Reserve Bank of India and the University Grants Commission, by amending their respective foundational Acts to regulate the Union government's role in their operational decisions.\n On the financial front, the party promises a comprehensive reform of the GST system.\n \"The current GST regime, which has eroded the fiscal autonomy of our states and led to heavy losses, will be reformed into a more equitable instrument of revenue distribution,\" it said.\n The party also promised to delink the Railway Budget from the Union Budget and allocate 5 per cent of the country's overall GDP to education.\n \"We promise to control petrol and diesel prices through the formulation of a price stabilisation fund…” Mr Mitra said.\n In regards to national security, the party promises to do away with the Agnipath Scheme and restore \"the Indian Armed Forces' traditional recruitment mechanisms.\"\n Releasing the manifesto, Mr O’Brien said, “These are the promises that we will fulfil as part of the INDIA bloc when it forms the next government.\" \n\n",

    "content": " Hyderabad: The Supreme Court on Tuesday adjourned the petition filed by Andhra Pradesh Government challenging the bail granted to Telugu Desam Party chief N. Chandrababu Naidu in connection with the Skill development case. \nThe plea came up before a supreme court bench, where the counsel standing for the state said that they have filed for an interlocutory application in the matter. \nThe bench observed that the said application was not found on record and decided to adjourn the matter to May 7. \nAdvocate Ranjith Kumar, the counsel for the state, has argued that Chandrababu Naidu should follow all the conditions set for the bail by the AP High Court except for the relaxations given by the top court like participating in public meetings. \nThe advocate told the court that Chandrababu Naidu and his son are threatening government officials while participating in public meetings. Chandrababu Naidu's counsel intervening the arguments said that the comments made by Naidu's son are irrelevant to the case. \nThe apex court after hearing the arguments said that it will take action if any such comments were made by the former chief minister. \n",
